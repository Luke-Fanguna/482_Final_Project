"Mr. President, I rise to speak on the condition of the file. Thank you, I rise as chair of Budget Sub One. And I want to echo the comments of my colleague from San Francisco To use our students, to use economic blackmail to influence speech is really what this is about, and in reading the conversations between the activists now saying Be careful, colleges, because the President is watching.

"Chair Lee and members of the committee, my name is Lucas Rhoads, and I'm testifying on behalf of NRDC, another proud sponsor of AB 363. As Laura's explained, neonics are a driving factor behind massive pollinator declines that threaten ecosystems and agriculture. DePR's reevaluation of neonics began in 2009, prompted by studies showing risks to bees from nonagricultural uses of neonics. Legislature required DPR to complete its reevaluation by 2018. But DPR has not proposed any mitigations for these nonagricultural uses. These pollinator protections are long overdue.",87,TRUE,"['NRDC','DPR']"

So nothing new, but we do have to collectively come together between government, industry, and basically everybody in the space to say how are we going to create that interoperability requirement?

"Now, in many areas of the state, particularly in the coastal region, a family must earn four to five times the California minimum wage to keep a roof over their heads.

"Its passage would neither vindicate nor amplify the arguments of the tribes, and its passage will not declare or imply that card rooms are in violation of the law. Moreover, if and when the matter comes before a court, there is no guarantee as to how a court may rule. It's important to note, however, that if the Legislature refuses to grant the legal standing needed for the courts to weigh in, we will remain no closer to a resolution of this long standing dispute.",85,TRUE,"['']"

"who, subsequent to that purchase, is subjected to new regulations that inhibit that intention. As an example, in South Austin we have a lot owner who owned a property eight years.

"I agree with the Assemblyman and you should take comfort in the fact that one of the directions that the Governor has given us, those of us who are working on this crisis, is to use as much data as there is available.

"There's obviously been a lot of newer trustees appointed. Senator Glazer, there's not been a single trustee I have talked to that doesn't care about this issue.

"They decide instead of having their own private security force, that they would contract with the Sheriff's department and we provide those contract services. This would be the exact same type of thing that we'd be able to offer to private schools, colleges, universities if they choose to do so.

"Thank you very much. It's a pleasure speaking from my own desk for a change. I just want to note that this is Mr. Butler's last bill, he's been serving with us admirably for many years.

"Thank you, Madam Speaker and Members. This Bill allows our California State Universities to utilize the low income housing tax credit to create more affordable housing for our amazing CSU staff and faculty. The lack of access to affordable housing in California has increased the difficulty for CSUs to recruit and retain diverse and qualified staff. Prior legislation has provided access to the LIHTC for our California Community Colleges as well to our K-12 faculty, making AB 2005 an easy next step to provide housing. For these reasons, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",95,TRUE,"['CSU']"
