"Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, today I rise to adjourn in the memory of Claudia Heller, a historian, explorer, and columnist who passed away December 11, 2023, at the age of 79. Claudia was the president of the Duardi Historical Society and Womens Clubs, serving as a steward to the city's historical museum, and for more than 30 years wrote a column for the Southern California News Group. In her column, she contributed greatly to promoting and preserving the captivating history of Duarte.",88,TRUE,"['Duardi Historical Society','Southern California News Group']"
"Is it a car sharing program? And so not only does it fund the planning, it funds the deployment. So those are just a couple of examples. I think the funds are used to help support our AB 617 Community Air Protection Program, where community steering committees can work with local air districts, CARB staff, and industry to come up with, again, community solutions that are specific to that area. So I guess I would disagree with the premise that our investments do not benefit communities and individuals.",88,TRUE,"['CARB']"
"Thank you, Assembly Member Carillo and Chairman Ting, for this opportunity for the NAACP to share thoughts on this very important issue. After listening to Congressman Castro and the previous speaker as well, I'm a little bit afraid of being redundant. I've heard some things today that are very reminiscent of the things that we talk about all the time. It is important, I think, that, as Dr. Ramon stated, I think it's important for us to examine why this issue of diversity is necessary to dig into.",88,TRUE,"['NAACP']"
"I appreciate the author making his commitment to drop parks and recreation and Department of Fish and Wildlife, especially in a year like this. From the Bill, I also want to point out that the DOF analysis did not give a specific estimate as to the cost to local law enforcement, but it did say tens to hundreds of millions. So I don't think any reasonable fee for decryptors is going to make up that cost that we would potentially be imposing upon our entire public sector through this.",89,TRUE,"['Department of Fish and Wildlife', 'DOF']"
"And we wanted to make sure that because there's a big issue of misclassification of workers at the ports, that these companies were following the law and not misclassifying drivers, that's not a very high labor standard, but that was reflecting the industry that this funding was going to. And so we started working with CARB on the standards that we wanted to set and how we wanted to do structuring the contracts. And they were like, we're not labor experts. We're not equipped to do this.",87,TRUE,"['CARB']"
"Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, we have with us today students from the law academy. This academy is only one of six here in California that is designated as the official partner to the California Bar Association. These students are here to not only partner with our local and statewide governments to learn about a career in law, but also to be advocates for their own community out there. And we have a few students and a few schools with us here today up in the gallery.",87,TRUE,"['California Bar Association']"
"Thank you, Chair and Members, good morning. There can be no doubt as to the incredible impact that the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, or SGMA, is having on all water users in California's over-drafted basins. It also cannot be understated just how much small rural communities and natural conservation areas have suffered because of decades of unregulated over pumping. There has been significant work done by Groundwater Sustainability Agencies, or GSAs, as we'll refer to them, local water users and the Department of Water Resources, to design and implement SGMA.",90,TRUE,"['Department of Water Resources']"
"These funds are important as we are rapidly approaching the state's goals of a 40% reduction in manure methane by 2030. As it stands today, the dairy sector has already achieved approximately a 35% reduction in manure methane. And with this GGRF funding at CDFA, with the federal dollars, we will exceed the full 40% reduction in the next few years. This will be three to four years ahead of the goal and is a major milestone, especially as other programs appear to be falling short on actual GHG reductions.",90,TRUE,"['GGRF', 'CDFA']"
"And as you know, Members, I come to this Legislature as special education and dual immersion educator. But what you may not know is that I served in that capacity with the very folks in this gallery today until December 4, the day before my swearing in.

Thank you so much.",90,TRUE,"['San Luis Coastal Unified School District@s Spanish English Dual Immersion language programs']"
"Any other questions from the Committee? I do. So, that's sort of an answer to the question that I had, which is, as you have heard in this report, they have said that there are likely fracking chemicals because there were fracking fluids in some of these improperly permitted underground injection wells that were connected to beneficial use.  So, what is the state? Do you believe that that is likely? What is your reaction in terms of action that the state board is going to take?",86,TRUE,"['Committee']"
"The Executive Director or whoever is that front person that drives the work, that individual has to have, I think extreme expertise, both in the structure of higher ed and the needs of the state, but also in sort of what happens in governing and politics in our state and be able to navigate that well with regards to the institutional influence around CPAC, the challenges with public Members of a governing board often come to these governing boards aren't as staffed as institutional leaders are.",86,TRUE,"['CPAC']"
"Yeah, thank you. Senator, typically, it's not unusual for audit requests to designate a particular entity that a member is interested and particularly, their district for Mr. Mccarthy, Sacramento. Excuse me, but we have had audits in the past where it's been left up to our discretion. Now certainly, that the Committee can decide that Los Angeles would be the county. If it were left up to us to determine what that additional county should be, the types of things we would consider is making sure we get north and south.",91,TRUE,"['Committee']"
"Good afternoon. Thank you for the invitation to come and speak with you today. My name is Kim Lew. I am the EMS Authority, known as EMSA's, Division Chief over the EMS Personnel Division.

"And it's incumbent upon our corporations and our business community and our private sector to lead the way. And many of these companies want to do that. That's why we have Google, Salesforce, Microsoft supporting. But not just tech companies, Levi's. They have complicated supply chain issues. Ikea, Apple.

"Well, essentially we contracted. There's 3000 roughly agencies, 2 million people, I think, covered in it. And we realized some time ago we started to have a disconnect between the understanding of the PERS compensable items that were in thousands of different labor contracts and what was really PERS compensable out of the system. And we discovered that through actuarial science, by the way. We realized, oh, we've got a disconnect between the financial risk that we took on and the actual financial risk that we're responsible for.",88,FALSE,"['PERS']"
"Because it goes against the agenda of emptying our prisons. We have had a prison overcrowding issue in California for over a decade. We had about 180,000 prisoners in prison. Not enough space. So what did we do? We passed AB 109. Prop 47. Prop 57, with the intent of emptying the prisons. And among that, we declared felonies that used to be serious and violent as no longer serious and violent. So when you sex traffic and you come to court, it is not a serious felony.",88,FALSE,"['']"
"Then rest until God moves to lift the veil from our impatient eyes. God's toss around all creatures may surprise and so gracious and merciful God, help our Legislator and all of us to believe in this new year that is given to us.

Let us know, excuse me, let us know the blessings that accompany our attempts to accomplish those necessary serious and great things. Amen.",89,FALSE,"['']"
"A primary goal in these cases is to make the victim whole. And here we are, Mr. Lackey. We are giving victim consideration. Most of the time the money is gone, not available for seizure. These two laws cleaning up the language in 186.11 A3 by untethering it from the sunsetted 12022.6 and bringing back 12022.6 with a higher threshold amount present the offender the prospect of actual prison time, but not necessarily its imposition. This presents the best method prosecutors have to obtain restitution for victims.",87,FALSE,"['']"
"Last year, a case in my district made the news when eight children were found unattended in a northeast Bexar County house. A three year old girl had been tied to a door with a leash and a two year old boy was chained up in the backyard. Many of the children had scars on their backs to suggest that they had been whipped regularly. Preliminary investigations found that the wounds that resulted from this horrific abuse did not meet the legal standard for serious bodily injury.",87,FALSE,"['']"
"But plenty of people get up in the morning and say they want to wipe Israel off the map. And the fact that it is a democracy in a sea of something much different and that we reach out to them and they reach out to us, and a lasting bond is critical and something we must celebrate. And I was quite proud to stand next to Governor Cuomo when he announced that the official policy of our state is if you boycott Israel, New York State will boycott you.",90,FALSE,"['']"
"There are some local governments that are very dependent on sales tax. So a modest change in state policy could bankrupt some of them. So if you actually change the economic substance, which is to say, limit how much the refund can be, limit how long the contract can last, rather than just addressing transparency. Be aware that, from my perspective, you need to allow gradualism in the change. Because if you do anything too disruptive, you're going to get some Chapter Nine filings out of a city or two.",90,FALSE,"['']"
And so there is quite a bit of work around marine mammal interactions. But we do need to do more that's specific to the West Coast and specific to the environment here in the United States. But I can say that our environmental studies program has done quite a bit of work. And one of the studies that has really received a lot of traction was the Entanglement study that looks at potential Entanglement risk due to potential floating cables that will connect the wind turbines here in the Pacific.,90,FALSE,"['']"
"So I know there's going to be a lot of conversations on that policy moving forward. So I certainly applaud the author for her deep interest in this space, really trying to take on an important issue. Regardless of what happens with the Bill today. I do think that our friends in the holler industry, I think they recognize this. But part of why bills like this are bubbling up is because there's so much stuff that's not getting recycled or composted under the current system.",86,FALSE,"['']"
"Today in California, we're helping 10 school districts using vehicle to grid in order to reduce the cost of electrifying their fleets and giving them more money for student instruction while supporting clean transportation and renewable penetration.

"Thank you, Madam President. Today, Members, I rise in support. While the merits of the resolution are enough to support on its own, honoring the thousands of law enforcement officers who sacrificed so much on our behalf, I also stand in memory of Sheriff Deputy Darnell Calhoun, to whom this resolution memorializes.

In addition to that, Darnell worked at his family's barbecue establishment.",85,FALSE,"['']"
"Any one of those. I mean, as long as they're going down the highway, they're a weapon. I don't know if you've ever had to take a driving defensive driving class.  I have. The whole thing is about defensive driving. It's a weapon. These trucks are going really quickly, and they can kill people, and they may not, but there's really good drivers that we have here, and we don't know what the autonomous vehicles are going to do until we actually are running them.",85,FALSE,"['']"
"As Californians and leaders in the mitigation of poverty, we understand greatly and firsthand how devastating a natural disaster can be to community. We know community Members seeking support and resources during natural disasters rely heavily on previously known community based organizations, and that means especially community action agencies and our partners.

Second, they are already in the community, so they are ready to respond timely in emergency situations.",85,FALSE,"['']"
"To be ready to meet the challenges posed by climate change, it is imperative to ensure all Californians have equitable access to clean and reliable transportation options. This means, as we move towards fulfilling our state's goal of reaching 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035, we must ensure EV drivers can meet the demands of this decarbonized future and have access to easy and comprehensive charging infrastructure. Unfortunately, EV charging stations are currently not universally accessible and do not allow for a standardized user experience.",85,FALSE,"['']"
"Well and the department agrees which is why we took the stance in the report that we took. Which was to require the plans to take a number of steps in order to ensure that the 2016 report is in better shape. We also referred all of the plans that had data error issues to our office of enforcement, our office of enforcement is conducting an ongoing investigation. So I can't say exactly what the penalties are going to be until that investigation is complete.",85,FALSE,"['']"
"Despite spending $1,000 more per student than the national average, California has consistently ranked below the national academic achievement among fourth through 8th graders for several years now. In the most recent national assessment of educational progress test, two of three California students didn't meet the state math standards, and one and more than half did not meet the English proficiency standards.

"Don't think for a second that in that 5% which houses 98% of our families with children, 98% of all of our families with children live in that one 5% area that I show crosshatched there. Don't think for a minute that this legislation won't undo the very nature and character of those subdivisions. Because it will, I am good parent, I will say that right off the bat. But I would no more raise my 13 year old and 16 year old children next to one of my own short-term rentals.",92,FALSE,"['']"
"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that. Just I want to know, I know you had a student increase since what you've seen at least by around 50 students, give or take. Have you seen, I mean the morale, the value that kids placed you see, has attendance improved since, you've shifted the culture, man. I mean, this is a beautiful thing that you're doing. You're changing the outlook, I believe, and you're giving them opportunities. So have you see an attendance and I mean, kids more inspired to come to school?",92,FALSE,"['']"
"But it also encourages regulators who might be worried about undue interference in the right to earn a living to also police themselves. So none of these approaches are mutually exclusive. Indeed I believe that they all reinforce one another. And for policymakers who value consumer protection, lower prices and greater opportunities for employment, especially among the most vulnerable populations. I think they would do well to consider these reforms. Thank you for the opportunity to share my research with you today. I look forward to answering any questions you may have.",92,FALSE,"['']"
"As mentioned, the mitigations could be in the thousands and what we're hoping for is that people make an informed decision if they decide to opt in that the debt service, mitigation and all costs are borne so that they can prosper if they choose to go forward.

"So I assume people have applications, and someone has to review them and approve them and so forth. And so how are we on that timeline, especially in relation to the IT support necessary to make that happen? So it's actually not January 1st, it's actually earlier that you need at least some kind, unless you're going to do on paper then switch it over to the IT systems. So where are we with that, and when are we going to start taking applications?",84,FALSE,"['']"
"The fight has been going on for many years, it seems unending. And the best estimates by experts are that somewhere between one and $3 billion annually are lost to fraud. And make no mistake, this is money directly out of the pockets of injured workers, and this is money directly out of the pockets of the employers in this state. One of the reasons I asked the State Auditor to take a look at the system was due to the seemingly intractable presence of a hugely unacceptable level of ongoing fraudulent activity.",93,FALSE,"['']"
"Well, thank you, Chair Roth. I'm very pleased to present SB 999. The bill will ensure that California suffering from mental health and substance use disorders can receive the appropriate level of treatment and care necessary for a full and lasting recovery.

Utilization review is when a health plan or disability insurer approves, modifies, or denies treatment based on what they consider medically necessary.",83,FALSE,"['']"
"Nothing wrong with parties consenting to it. No problem about that. The due process problem is If I have a constitutional right and you can take it from me, and I have no due process, that creates a problem. By the way, do you realize this is the only law that's ever been passed where the defendant cannot win. You want to put that over in worker's comp? You want to put that in tort cases where the defendant can never win? Whoa.",83,FALSE,"['']"
"No one thought vehicles would be produced in California again [inaudible], a few years ago, is an example of getting least cost emission reductions in vehicles as a result of electricity, and those cross pollicizations I think are really why AB-32 and now SB-32 are really kind of genius policy, because they really do allow you to find places to work across missions.

"Just one more. This one, I want to thank Mr. Chairman Hunter for working with us. And I want to continue working with him on the bill. I think there's an intent here. I think government entities, when an employee leaves, there needs to be a process to get documents back to the extent they can. The problem is extending the civil liability or criminal liability for years into the future, I think is the key concern there.Happy to take more questions.",82,FALSE,"['']"
"The bottom line reason for this is that these loans are all made by private lenders and for a variety of reasons they are concerned about lending down the credit spectrum right now. Again, the main point of this is you've got millennials not buying, you have tight credit, you have people who are foreclosed on, that is adding a whole element of population to what was, already, folks facing higher rents and that puts a burden on the rental housing stock.",82,FALSE,"['']"
"I think we all know that, you know, when we pass policies here, we often don't have enough resources to enforce, you know, the laws and the policies that we're passing here, and that's part of the point of this bill, that major coastal resorts will be required to self-audit themselves so that we can further ensure that they are, in fact, complying with existing laws and regulations. I don't know if any of you here want to add anything to that?",82,FALSE,"['']"
"If you look at the income tax for the middle-class tax refund that the state just implemented last year, that was $150,000. If you look at what qualifies as a medium individual and family income in Marin County as an example for affordable housing under HUD regulations, right now, family of four low income is $146,000, and for an individual, it's $100,000.

"There are restrictions, actually on driver's license right now. However, this Bill does give permissive language to the definition saying that a researchable database can include driver's license photos, which is part of what incident happened here.

"You don't nibble around the edges, you just go all out. And I think that's great, because we got to keep the conversation going. I think sort of on its face, obviously, this is something that people should have, and we have a lot of places in California where they don't get clean air and they don't get clean water. But I think what concerns, just to simplify, is I can't wrap my head around what without like intent language.",80,FALSE,"['']"
"Yes, and it's just, it's here and there. So, if you'll remember, over the past, there was an incident that received statewide attention in Smith County, in Tyler, years ago.

"Well again, through the written discovery, each of those 40 defendants or 100 defendants can submit every question they want in writing. Often they use the response to written derogatories as a guide in a follow up deposition to ask the same questions through oral questioning.

"New Zealand. Some of our colleagues actually spent some time in New Zealand looking at their system that I think is much more dedicated on the healing of young folks and recognizing the role that that plays in public safety, because, to be quite honest, what we've created right now does nothing for public safety.

We have operated for 23 years, always paying wages above industry standards and offering a generous benefit package that includes health insurance, 401K benefits, sick and vacation leave, as well as many paid holidays.",77,FALSE,"['']"
"Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. So we are certainly supportive of the concept of providing additional funds for deferred maintenance. We think deferred maintenance is a really important issue for the state to tackle and so we appreciate the administration doing that. However, we have raised several concerns as have been referenced. One of them is that we don't think that there's a clear basis for the funding levels and sort of the allocation across departments.",77,FALSE,"['']"
"The average tax credit loss for people over 60 is about $2,000, but let me give you a specific example. A 60 year old whose income is at the federal poverty line and who now, under the Affordable Care Act, receives a tax credit of somewhere between 8 to $10,000. Would see her tax credit drop to $4,000. Now, the way the tax credits were designed was to enable that person to be able to cover their healthcare costs. Who in the United States can cover their healthcare costs with $4,000? No one. It also as I mentioned weakens Medicare.",100,FALSE,"['']"
"And it's a very complex program, there's a lot of moving parts. I have a pretty ambitious set of notes that I'm going to try and get through, but I think I can do it in a timely fashion. In it's simplest form, this program consists of the consumer paying a deposit on the beverage container, the consumer returning that container, and the program ensuring that there is infrastructure in place for that consumer to go.",76,FALSE,"['']"
"Yes, Chairman. The county is able to charge a toll, and those have to be approved by the general land office. And they have an existing toll collection system right now. And they're in a position too where they need to make a major investment in upgrading their system. But if we can provide a proposal and bring them onto our system, then that would make a lot more sense for the County at this point. ",76,FALSE,"['']"
"Another thing, an observation I have, is that there have been persistent attacks on the so called mainstream media out there, and I chuckle sometimes. I don't mean to say it's a laughing matter, but I look at that and I know that it's appearing in all those stories because the journalists themselves want to be fair and therefore they put some of that craziness in there without necessarily fact checking because it's about themselves again.",76,FALSE,"['']"
trafficking rings by filing unknowingly false and deceptive report that the firearm was lost or stolen. This legislation would help deter and combat such behavior by specifically criminalizing the act of knowingly filing these deceptive reports to law enforcement about the loss or theft of a firearm. This offense involves intentional deception and obstruction of law enforcement efforts to keep guns out of dangerous hands and should be treated accordingly. We urge you to vote aye.,76,FALSE,"['']"
"No, even, and that's what we found out too, even with the shelters, a lot of people don't realize when you go to a shelter, you have to sign up and be there at a certain time. You can't just walk in and be like, can I just stay here? It doesn't work like that. You have to stand in line and you better be in line early enough that you can get in the shelter.

"And so just to see that kind of story that comes out of the Bronx is so heartfelt to all of us that represent the Bronx and have a relationship with the Montefiore. I think you probably have an operation in every one of our Assembly District, so you are part of the Bronx fabric. But for what you did, and to do God's work, because that was a miracle in the job that they did.",76,FALSE,"['']"
"Thank you, Mr Chair. So, just give us a little bit more explanation on the funding on this. So, you said there is no impact to the state. So, is this is just going to be an appropriation that would re allocate funds that we're receiving from the federal government, and the total bucket is not changing or is this 10 million that we're going to be additionally requesting, or give us some additional information please.",76,FALSE,"['']"
"Thank you Mr. Chair and thanks to the author and to the witnesses. You know I was interested in knowing, and I appreciate it Superintendent, our teacher framing of the impact that these programs can provide and that we've known for so long, we've been saying for so long that early childhood education was the key. And it's just sad that we live in a society that doesn't put its money where its mouth is.",75,FALSE,"['']"
"We applaud Senator Allen for introducing SB 867, which will provide a structured investment plan to address the challenges of climate change and provide stable, long term funding for nature based climate solutions. Governor Newsom has issued several reports and Executive orders that have created a roadmap to climate resiliency in California that will help guide and direct investments. The strategic plans also underscore the need for significant funding for climate and nature based solutions.",75,FALSE,"['']"
"but not exclusively the elders throughout the state. The hospice part has been a continual issue, and some of that is patient driven. We live in a society that still does not have, I would say, as great an acceptance of death as part of life, as perhaps other societies. So, I think a lot of our society wants to be treated aggressively, even when the chance that that's going to help is somewhat limited. ",75,FALSE,"['']"
"Thank you, Mr. Speaker. AB 273 is a continuation of our efforts to combat an epidemic in Indian Country on Missing and Murdered Indigenous People. This bill would accomplish three things, requiring social workers and probation officers to notify that the child is missing from foster care, and an expedited court review of the child's case and updating definitions to maximize the protection of children missing from foster care. I ask for your aye vote.",75,FALSE,"['']"
"And for us to call ourselves a first world society and still want to be barbaric in how we house people, whether you're a prisoner or not, is just inhumane, to say the least. So I appreciate this measure. It's long overdue, and we need to change, and European countries have clearly changed their approach to how they house prisoners and treat them, and if we're talking about rehabilitation and things of that nature, locking someone in a room for 23 hours a day doesn't help whatsoever. So I'm going to leave it at that. And if you would like to close.",102,FALSE,"['']"
"I mean, per square mile, it's like three or four people for the whole county. So when you talk about trying to combine, it's very difficult to do that. We would be obviously looking at those opportunities if they were available to us. It's not like even in the central valley where you have bigger communities and you have a lot of different. We've, we've looked at, and there was bills before that, but in this case, there's just nobody else out there. And we want to get people. You can't run a board meeting without people there to run the board.",102,FALSE,"['']"
"Now, metric, as a system of track and trace, it requires that the cultivator log it if they have manicured the plant, meaning we have to document each transition, the planting, the flowering, the manicuring, harvesting, et cetera. So the tags don't help with that. What would help with that is those onsite inspections where the agents just come in, they walk the field and they see, hey, those look like they've been topped.",74,FALSE,"['']"
"is something that we have to watch closely. But right now, with 1,000 people moving here every day and the record number of visitors, we still see enough usage of the gas tax at this point. To make sure that we're still healthy, but your concerns are very well founded, sir. In the future, it's something we'll have to watch very closely as electric cars come more online and play more of a role.",74,FALSE,"['']"
"Yeah, but, so I think it even goes further in the way that we're describing it such that even if was upheld unlawfully. So I think it's irrelevant in terms, I think with respect to whether or not it was obtained lawfully, unlawfully. It simply says that if it was obtained with the intent to be used lawfully with the deceased, then that becomes the defense. So in your hypothetical, any sharing situation that you're describing, I think absolutely falls within this provision. That would allow the defendant to advance the defense for homicide. Sharing by definition, I think fits within joint use.",103,FALSE,"['']"
"And I appreciate them giving me their time and letting me walk them through the process ahead of the meeting today. But our intent was, let's bring it out in public here today for everybody to hear at the same time, so we're not off on different directions or we're not reading about it in the news media, and then getting our information ahead of the meeting from media reports and so forth.",73,FALSE,"['']"
"And polemic issues that tear the fabric of who we are as a nation. I have never seen to date an issue that really brings across a spectrum, Democrats and the Republicans, Whites, Latinos, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, racially mixed, like this issue on the developmentally disabled community, and it was very, very eye-opening for me and I'll give a little funny story. Down in San Diego off the coast, perhaps near La Hoya or Del Mar, my family. I grew up in San Diego on the border region, and my family was driving at, I think it was Pacific Coast Highway, adjacent to Del Mar.",104,FALSE,"['']"

When we get loans from the banks of New York those loans are at a very low",72,FALSE,"['']"
So we need to provide a pathway for compliance to get people out to get actually so as to get as many people licensed as possible. And we can't do that with the current licensing structure. So we're trying to get as many people into the system as possible to get a better handle on how we move forward with that best practices. And the current licensing structure was just an error.,72,FALSE,"['']"
"I want to go back and just follow up on my colleague, Mr. Williams's live discussion. There was cost savings that could be certainly recognized, if it wasn't money set aside to do out of state recruitment. What was that dollar amount that was set aside to do that specific job task? I know we talked about, you couldn't pull out the salaries, but what was the overall budget allocated for that?",72,FALSE,"['']"
"So allow up to 4% of the fund to be pledged against their debts, while leaving in place all those same standards that were in place in the bill we did in 2014 plus the ones we're adding here, Mr. Chairman, in this sub. And so I think we have a number of witnesses to speak for the bill. And I think you'll see a good cross coalition of people coming together",72,FALSE,"['']"
"In addition to Los Angeles County, we also filmed in Humboldt County and Inyo County. And in fact, some of the most beautiful scenes in the film were shot in the Redwoods in Humboldt.

The producers were happy that they could stay at home with their families and",71,FALSE,"['']"
"And Severn said something very important. This is the rocket and feather phenomena. The price shot up and then subsided in the spot market where it set, but floated down in the retail market that's been observed for many years. I think the explanation is that the contracts force the price up the next day when the spot market goes up. But the contracts do not force retailers to compete immediately.",71,FALSE,"['']"
"The judge sentenced me to those 30 days. During those 30 days, my children were not able to be provided with their meds without me cause I'm a single parent. I found a job, I had gotten everything in order, I tried to pay off my tickets and get my license back but it hindered me from doing so much stuff because the judges threw me in there for 30 days.",71,FALSE,"['']"
"They are the people, the courageous people, who have humanized this issue and have helped shape public opinion in its favor.
