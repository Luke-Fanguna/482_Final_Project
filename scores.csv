False,,"However, some of the speed with which they want to move, could threaten a lot of people out in the community, in your districts, today and their family members who have certain arrangements set up and programs that they work with the individuals in the agencies in their community and, you know, literally if the federal government were allowed to move forward and some of the guidelines that with literally throw people out of existing programs because it wouldn't be funded anymore under federal funding.",0.0
False,,"And, we've got to keep a careful watch on that.  I think we're also at a point in time, where everybody would agree that the system has been, at least in the community which serves 270,000 Californians and their families every day, we are at a point of chronic underfunding.",0.0
False,,"And, we're looking for more from the department than just simply doing their job and following along in the budget process.

I can't imagine living every day in the place where I was abused, with perpetrators or people who investigated these crimes being allowed to walk freely among there.",0.0
False,,"And, that wouldn't happen in the community.  In the community, people would be arrested, they would be prosecuted, programs to be closed.",0.0
False,,"The last thing on the developmental centers, it is a great idea to look at other uses.  We would ask the department and Mr. Doyle to look very carefully at the proposition of the $500,000,000 that we spend in the operations of developmental centers today and, probably, the $700,000,000 in property that we have today and look at some transfer of those assets into the community to address those problems that were raised earlier.",0.0

False,,"Jennifer Kuhn, Leg. Analyst. So, when the state started implementing the LCFF, that base year, it was 72% of funded. It had more generous targets and it knew that it would take a number of years to get up to those targets. Under the governor's budget we've estimated for 2015/2016, so just a few years later the state would be 85% funded. So it made considerable progress. It would be slightly ahead of schedule in that regard. Having said that though, because the targets are COLAed, you have to have growth in the guarantee that's quite a bit faster than COLA to make a serious dent in to getting there. Under our 5 year forecast, we have the last year of the period at about 90 some percent funded. So, still it would take again a number of years. Although we appear to be on track, it really depends on what happens to the guarantee moving forward. It's very straightforward to calculate. If we were at the full rates today, it would cost the state $57 billion and $9 billion of it would be associated with supplemental concentration funding for English learners and low-income students.",0.0
False,,"It's not quite as easy to say exactly how much that we're giving out can be associated with those students because it's really based on what they were given, and a closing of the gap, but what we do know by design how much they're supposed to get and some day we'll know exactly how much they're getting. In the end term we are really relying on these plans to have districts described to us what they're doing. So at a minimum we can at least know what they're telling us they are doing.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Madame Chair. As many of you know, I've been a big advocate of the courts and fought like heck to ensure that the trial court's get as much funding. Hopefully, you have seen the recent audit by the state auditor, which was very enlightening and unbelievably disturbing in a lot of ways. I might be one that on this panel that may be looking at doing things another way, at cutting the court budget because of some of the problems that we see in that while trial court rooms are being closed all across this state for lack of funds. We're paying about 8 managers $179,000, more than your boss the governor, more than the general manager department of general services who manages thousands of employees, which is about 800 employees, averaging about $28,000 than anybody else at that same level.",0.0
False,,"In addition, they're maintaining the fleet about 66 cars. 7.2 million employees are part time and could have been done by the trial courts, but they're being charged for that. There is about $30 million in questionable court spending and salaries. The audit points out about $186 million that could go directly to trial courts, which everyone who was here the last two years on the budget, that I've been here, that was the number one priority: getting money to the trial court. It looks like there's hundreds of millions not getting to them because AOC and judicial council. I was the director of real estate. We're leasing space in San Francisco, instead of here in Sacramento.",0.0
False,,"People aren't together with their managers and with their employees. I'll do it for free. I used to be Director of Real Estate. I will get that done pretty quick. So, this kind of Marie Antoinette feeling ""let them eat cake"", I know it is only 4.2% of the budget, but those individuals make 100% of the decisions on the budget. I just want to know if the governor has any -  I know that the audit came out about the same time as the budget coming out, but he does he have any feelings on what we can do? Should we start by cutting it by $93 million until they can prove that they can come up with a over $186 million worth of savings and efficiencies because I'm trying to get a quarter-of-a-billion back to the trial courts, which we can do if everyone's cooperative on the judicial council and AOC side.",0.0

False,,"We're all in strong support of Dr. Capitman's appointment to the governing board today and urge you to move this forward.  As you heard, Dr. Capitman  is committed to building coalitions in leadership for community health in the San Joaquin Valley and to really highlighting the air pollution burdens on valley children, seniors, and disadvantaged communities through his research and educational efforts.",0.0
False,,"Since his appointment to the board, he's already demonstrated his commitment to disadvantage communities by meeting regularly with community members to hear concerns, formulate solutions, and to bring a high-level of analysis of the community impacts to the board decisions.",0.0
False,,"Given the severe nature of air pollution challenges facing valley residents, Dr. Capitman's experience, expertise, and dedication are vital to leading the value to a prosperous and cleaner future.  So, we urge you to support this nomination and thank you Dr. Capitman for your service. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Jennifer Kuhn Leg Analyst, our understanding is that the U.C.  budget has become quite interesting, because on the one hand the Governor is expressing concern about their costs; about the cost per degree, there part cost per completion that cost per student. At the same time providing some money for the cost to go up without enrollment growth. So, it's just an  even higher spending per degree, higher spending per student.",0.0
False,,"So, I think this is just trying to foster a conversation; let's be comfortable as a state, as a University that whatever costs are generated are important enough that folks are willing to share in the funding of them. And again, it's just within this broader context of if there is a concern with costs at U.C.'s let's sort of try to address it coherently as opposed to in pieces.",0.0

I've seen some things myself that have made me slap my forehead, and, but I think that they want to get better.

False,,"Good afternoon, Steve Cruz on behalf of The California Building Industry, so first I want to start with the thank you for the bond is critical to the housing and development so your work and craft of the bond, and delivery, I think it was a hundred eighteen votes in support was very impressive, so now as you move to implementation I would echo comments made about today about moving officially and deliberately of course through the process as you know for housing development. We have to plan a twenty-year horizon as a result of the show me the water laws, so projects that are before local councils and local governments today have to demonstrate dedicated funding source for those projects twenty years out so the faster that you move, the faster that less projects are threatened at the local level and they're all important us.",0.0
False,,"Senator Nielsen mentioned surface storage, that's certainly critical for ground water storage, but recycle water, conservation, home builders have come a long way in making homes more efficient so that's an important component to it, desalination, all those things are very important, the last thing I would say, sort of guard against, you know, rewriting the bond in ways that aren't consistent with the will of that the legislature, the voters, and I think that's important, and really want to continue to work with this committee, and would love an opportunity to come at a later date if you think that's important to have a further input, so thank you again.",0.0

That's where we are today. We need leadership.",0.0
False,,"We need a different solution, a paradigm shift in thinking. We're hopeful that this gentleman will be allowed to explore that, but if not, we absolutely need the legislature to bring the heat to make that happen. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.",0.0
False,,"AHF is the largest medical care provider, private provider, in the world for people with HIV and AIDS, about 380,000 patients worldwide, 16,000 patients here in our home state of California. This is a huge issue. We appreciate the Governor and the department recognize the importance of it and carving out a certain amount of money to help close the gap.",0.0
False,,"The problem though, is not making sure that we have the money. The problem is making sure that drug prices are fair and rational and work well within the construct of our state budget. We need to make changes in how we fund drug prices, not putting in 300 million dollars for this and 300 million dollars for that. Mr. Chiu, we appreciate your taking a leadership role.",0.0
False,,"For those who don't know, Mr. Chiu has introduced a bill, I think as of today, that begins the process of trying to get the drug prices under control. The last thing I'd like to point out is, this is not just a hep C issue. While hep C is important to AHF because it's often a comorbidity of people with HIV, anti-retro-virals for people with HIV have been a huge problem in terms of pricing, for more than a decade.",0.0
False,,"And we've been trying to get those prices under control. The department has work to do that as well. We've had some success, but not nearly as much success as we need to get this whole issue under control. We encourage the legislature to really aggressively take on this issue from a policy standpoint as much as from a budget standpoint. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and members, Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We're very interested in this 300 million dollar set-aside for one hepatitis C therapy, which there's no dispute. The importance of these new therapies on medical treatment.",0.0
False,,"And, we're also very interested in the role that  our member health plans can play in the worker process down the line as it's fully developed. So while we're encouraged that the administration is taking this very seriously, it is very worrisome from our perspective that the state even has to set aside this large amount of funding just for one particular drug.",0.0
False,,"Particularly, since the pricing of these drugs is somewhat of a mystery. A few weeks ago, in the Senate Health Committee, the representative for one of the manufactures stated in committee that they do not base their pricing for these drugs on the cost of development, which we find to be very curious.",0.0
False,,"So, from our perspective the 300 million dollar set-aside may not truly reflect on the entire cost to the state as has been discussed. Some of our MediCal managed care plans are still working with the state to receive other supplemental kick payment for hepatitis C drugs.",0.0
False,,"So, again the 300 million dollars may not entirely reflect that, and we have some questions in the department on that issue. Ultimately, we are encouraged that the LAO be taking a second look at this at the time, and they may revise. It might do us good to ask the LAO or some other state entity to take a longer-term, longitudinal approach, I've always wanted to say that word on the mic, with respect to the analysis.",0.0
False,,"It's very important, in 2015 it's expected that about 12 new blockbuster drugs will be entering the market, so how are we going to pay for these in public programs in the commercial market, and that's a huge concern for us. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and Members Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. While we don't have a formal written position on this particular proposal yet, we have supported similar proposals in the past. We do think the underlying value here is coordination and continuity of care in a logical enrollment process that is designed to reflect at least other aspects of the health care system. So, if this item is held open, we hope it's given fair consideration and some reflection, particularly since the department has gone a long way in limiting if you will the proposal, at least in comparison to proposals that have been offered in the past. So we hope that you will fairly consider it as it's held open thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Chairman Quirk, Chairwoman from the state senate. This is a very important hearing. What will happen today hopefully will start the discussion, but more important, start us looking at solutions and how we curb the amount of police abuse that are going on not only in California but in the nation. It is my hope that California becomes the example and the template for how you reduce police violence and brutality.",0.0

False,,But she's now working within the Los Angeles Police Department with Chief Beck to come up with alternatives to how you solve this problem.,0.0

False,,"That we don't have all white male law enforcement agencies in this state or in this country. Because I believe they are the solution for how to stem what's going on, but also doing a paradigm shift in the way we police and the way we interact with the public.",0.0
False,,And so I want to thank Senator Hancock and Assembly Member Quirk for pulling together this committee. I'm looking forward to getting some input.,0.0

One, I want to know what information you would need to be able to produce that for this committee, what kind of resources you would need to implement that within DOJ,",0.0

False,,"But we also need to know, what do you need to do to compile the amount of information you need to give an effective reporting back to us, and how long would that take?",0.0
False,,"Maybe we can talk about this offline, because I don't want... I have people coming to my office that want to legislate it.",0.0
False,,"And if we can do it through the budget process, which would be quicker, faster, much more effective, I would like to do it that way.",0.0
False,,"Otherwise we'll be, you know, six months, eight months down the road through the legislative process and then it's gonna take you another probably year to get funding to get ramped up. Let's get all the way to the funding and ramped up part. You can come to my office, we can sit and I can give you the parameters of what everyone's looking for as far as use of force, and what we ultimately want to find, both on law enforcement side and on the public side.",0.0
False,,"- And thank you for your testimony. My question's just a little bit different. You're an African American male who's within the system that's dealing with your colleagues, your law enforcement officers. And I know there's a code of silence and I know there is this thing where you don't basically rat out another fellow officer.",0.0
False,,"How do you handle it when you know some of your fellow officers aren't behaving appropriately? You know inside of your heart you need to say something, you need to do something to stop that behavior because with one or two of you do something wrong, you're all painted with the same brush.",0.0
False,,"Heaven knows any elected official will tell you that. What that feels like. But how do you handle that, so that this distrust or even the rogue cops, they're doing things that are illegal or brutalizing the community. You know it. You know who they are. How do you personally handle that?",0.0

False,,"Yes, it's good to see you, Sheriff Christianson, and Deputy Sheriff Brown, just need to let you know that the Ceasefire One Program is something that we're gonna look at it budgets of five, I haven't told Assembly Member Lackey yet, but we're looking to hopefully fund it in the CalGRIP program. So I just gave him a heads up.",0.0
False,,"Well, it's the CalGRIP program, so hopefully it trickles down to the appropriate people. Actually my question is for Tingirides because I work with Connie Rice, and she mentioned you. Actually I have three questions. And two of them is just because I wanna verify whether or not it's an urban legend. Plus a lot of these stories don't get out.",0.0
False,,"Especially the good stories with LAPD and I would like for you to repeat it, not only here for us in the committee, but also for everyone in the audience, that when you change the way you police, you get some unintended consequences that could be very very good.",0.0
False,,"And so I just need to verify, one, well it's about Christopher Dornan, and when he went on his crazy rampage against officers, it's my understanding he was going to try to go and kill a former Captain that he used to have, and he was going after them, and the Bounty Hunter Crips gang, which is your natural adversary within the Nickerson Projects, I believe they wanted to help.",0.0

And then the third thing is, Connie talked about funding, Connie Rice, getting it off the ground, ensuring that the officers are there for five years, so that there's some continuity.",0.0
False,,"Looking at the way you do policing in a different way, giving you incentives for doing keeping people off the street, getting kids out of gangs, and that's how you get paid, and that's how you get your ""atta boys"" by doing that more so.",0.0
False,,"But where are you now? As far as, that was five years, you started in 2011, we're here now, will you continue to be funded, do we need to worry about whether or not this program starts to wane after so many years?",0.0

False,,Miss Weber was first.,0.0
False,,"Afternoon, Rosa Aqeel with Pico, California. I just wanted to make a couple observations. First, I think it's really unfortunate that all of the law enforcement officers have left. I think that if those are the good guys, then that's really, really concerning. I would hope that they would wanna hear what the community has to say, especially given that most of the folks that are speaking are folks of color.",0.0

False,,And it builds the chasm that exists already between communities of color and law enforcement. So I think that we have to be really thoughtful about what that's really saying.,0.0
False,,"Because if those really are the good guys and not even the good guys will say that black lives matter, that people of color matter, that there are things that are messed up in existing practices, then how are we ever to trust them?

False,,"This is when I put my budget hat on.

False,,And I welcome everyone here to our first meeting as we look at the budget.,0.0
False,,"There's several issues and items that we want to obviously look at. Last year I think we did a phenomenal job in looking at recidivism and really really tackling it. Taking the bull by the horn and starting to, taking the CDCR we have corrections and rehabilitation. The r in rehabilitation for a long-time had been small r,  and we made it to a medium-size and are trying to get to a big r again.

False,,"And if individuals who are incarcerated that can fall within those rules we should be able to provide them steps to get there. Unfortunately in a society like this, we will always have to have room for individuals who do not want to participate in this society in a lawful same way.

We have to kind of do a complete turnaround on how we deal with this, and I like the fact that sector (inaudible) is the first to say, once we close prison, we truly save money; so I think we're all on the same page we just need to figure out how to get there.",0.0

False,,"But, I would like to get and for the Committee, we spent five-point-one million on this, and is your way. We can kind of get how that money was dispersed and expenditures,   which you spent it on, for example I think the first program may have gotten dogs out of shelters or sickly dogs for free,  and now these dogs are worth about five thousand dollars a piece, so what makes these dogs so much better than the five thousand-dollar dogs or is that all up in training them and just kind of getting the idea of where we're going and how we're proceeding.",0.0

False,,"Jennifer Kuhn from the Legislative Analyst's Office, and we released our higher ed analysis last week. I was gonna speak directly from the report. Thought I'd spend just a minute on some overview topics, but then dive to performance, which the legislature has indicated it would like to embed as part of budget deliberations, and then make some very high level comments on enrollment, operations, facilities, and costs of sharing, very quickly because I know that you'll be talking about these issues in more depth as you move forward.",0.0
False,,"Starting on page 12 of the report, it shows core funding for each of the segments, focused then on both state general fund as well as tuition revenue, so this is figure five on page 12. And just starting at the top you can see that for UC their budget total core funding again, state general fund and student tuition revenue, 6.3 billion.",0.0
False,,"Under the governor's proposal he's increasing it the 140 million, a 2% increase. This is what you've been hearing earlier today. All of the increase is coming from the state. For CSU you can see their total core funding budget of 5.4 billion, the increase level 158 million. It's a 3% increase and again you can see it's all coming from the state general fund.",0.0
False,,"Just moving down to community colleges, their core funding budget. Again, less reliant on student fee revenue, more reliant on local property tax monies. Their core funds budget is 8.7 billion, an increase of 737 million year over year. Of that 737 million, 500 million is for adult education consortia.",0.0
False,,"So it's helping to fund the state's restructured adult education system. If you were to exclude that, although you wouldn't necessarily want to do that, funding adult education is part of what community colleges do. But without that the increase would be 3%.",0.0
False,,"On page 13 there's just a list of budget proposals. That's what you'll be working through systematically in the weeks to come. So talking about, over the last few years the legislature has taken action to develop some performance measures to ask the segments to develop targets and then voiced an interest in using those budget reviews to inform its budget deliberations.",0.0
False,,"If you turn to page 15, it lifts the performance measures that the state has adopted. And what this particular figure shows is current performance in most cases, 2013-14, and the target in here it's just shown for 2017-18. For the sake of time I'm not going to go through every aspect of the table, but I think highlighting just a few things will illustrate a broader point.",0.0
False,,"If you look for example under graduation rates the four year rate for freshman entrances at UC, you can see that they're at 62%, they have a goal of getting to 66% by 2017. You can see for CSU their six year rate that they're at 53%, they have a plan to getting to 55%.",0.0
False,,"So these aren't necessarily their aspirational targets. What the state asked them to do is under the governor's plan, tell us what you plan to do, what you plan to achieve over this period. So as you can see they've planned to achieve some modest improvements in their graduation rates.",0.0
False,,"A key issue for you is, is this enough? Is moving from 53% to 55% between 2013 and 2017 sufficient progress? Going down in the table you can see funding per degree as well as units per degree. Two measures that are often looked at from an efficiency perspective, are students able to get out with fewer excess units?",0.0
False,,"Are they able to get out with less spending per degree? You can see at both UC and CSU from where they are right now to where they plan to be in 2017 increases in funding per degree, and no reduction in units per degree, or in excess units.",0.0
False,,"So again it might be something that you want to consider rather than just having the segments tell you what they plan to do, what is it that you would hope that they would achieve over this period of time, and is this improvement in this graduation rates and sort of lack of improvement in units per degree and funding per degree something that you think is acceptable, or something that you would like to participate in dialogue with the universities to see if you might want to set different targets?",0.0
False,,"Again, working collaboratively with them to figure out what is realistic with the resources at hand. On page 17, the state has, and the community college system has similar performance measures that are better tailored to the community college system. For example they have a completion rate somewhat comparable to a graduation rate.",0.0
False,,"This is for students who indicate they have a serious academic plan. How many of them within six years complete an associate's degree transfer complete enough courses to transfer. You can see it's 48% overall, and that their target is to improve by 1% of this rate. So for example to improve from 48% to 48.5% year over year. Again it's a very similar issue for you. Is this adequate? Or would you hope that these targets might be more ambitious?",0.0
False,,"You can see also on community colleges just turning a few pages in the report to page 20, that their six year completion rates have been slightly declining, even when you take or hear a broader perspective and you look back in time. So turning then from performance to the basic cost components of the universities and the community colleges budgets.",0.0
False,,"Starting with enrollment, there's been lots of conversation already today about enrollment. The governor for UC and CSU takes one approach which is not to have enrollment expectations, and his approach has been, well, I don't really want to do enrollment based budgeting for UC and CSU because this undermines a conversation about quality.",0.0
False,,"But then for community colleges he provides 2% enrollment growth, and he provides some money that's specifically for student support and success. So, we'd encourage you to take more of his approach for community colleges, which is not to have to choose between access and quality, but every year you're really focused on how to balance access and quality, just as he's doing with the community colleges we would recommend you do for UC and CSU.",0.0
False,,"That is, determining how much enrollment growth you want at each system, and then if there are extra endeavors you want to improve, student support, student success, you make targeted investments in those areas.",0.0
False,,"So to help you get your hands around, what is appropriate enrollment growth at each of the segments, we did what we normally do in terms of looking at the high school, public high school graduates, looking at the college age population in California, looking at the segment's admission data and trying to figure out what it tells us.",0.0
False,,"So demographically the college age population is declining between 2015 and 2016 it's going down about 1%. It's steadily declining, projected to over the next five years. So, when you look all the way out to 2020, the college age population 18 to 24 year olds is about 300 thousand individuals fewer than 2015.",0.0
False,,"So then we also looked at their admits and how many students they're turning away, and UC indicates that it's still admitting all eligible students, both freshman and transfers somewhere in the system. CSU indicates that it's not admitting all eligible transfer students.",0.0
False,,"When we look at their admits for freshmen, it does appear that they're still drawing from their master plan eligibility pool. When you look at their transfer students it's a little bit more complicated in that if they're turning away non-local transfer students, we're not sure there's a capacity issue, and that CSU is designed to serve local students.",0.0
False,,"So if the student had applied to their local campus and gotten in, then it's not clear there's a capacity issue. So, we've just been suggesting that you ask CSU for some finer grain details so that you could determine is there an access problem?",0.0
False,,"Is there a campus that's turning away eligible local transfer students and not accepting any non-local transfer students, such that they don't have capacity already existing if they just reorganized how they did their admits.",0.0
False,,"For community colleges, you've talked about this a little. In the current year they got 2% growth. I'm sorry, in the current year they got 2.75% growth. Based on their current enrollment they're coming in at about 2% growth. So, it's unlikely that they'll get all the way to 2.75 percent in the current year in 14-15.",0.0
False,,So it's something that you'll have more data on in May to try to figure out what you want to do both in the current year and the budget year. What happens in the current year will just happen automatically in terms of how much access they were actually able to provide.,0.0
False,,"If it's 2% in the current year it's likely that something like 2% in the budget year would be reasonable. So just some final comments on operations, facilities, and cost of education. If you turn to page 37, you'll see that right now the state is taking very different approaches on how specifically it's funding each of the higher education segments.",0.0
False,,"So you can see in some cases there's very few strings attached. For UC it's giving them 4%. As you've already talked about today this is creating some, I think, confusion and frustration because you're not quite sure what you're getting from the 4%.",0.0
False,,"Have you gotten enrollment growth or haven't you? Have you gotten just mandatory cost increases? Have you gotten retirement increases covered? As the state has traditionally done we continue to suggest you figure out what are your objectives, and then fund those objectives specifically.",0.0
False,,"If it's enrollment growth, if it's a COLA, if it's stat service increases, retirement, that the state, that you're specific about what you'd like. Even when it comes to base increases the governor has different approaches. For community colleges he funds a COLA, for UC, SCU he just provides the 4% not linked to a COLA.",0.0
False,,"So again, my main message here is just thinking about what you want to achieve. Is it purchasing power, holding it constant? Is it paying for retiree healthcare cost increases, pension increases? For that you go ahead and prescribe what you think are state priorities for the segments.",0.0
False,,"If you turn to page 56 and 57, it itemizes UC and CSU's capital outlay requests, and I just wanted to make two points here. One of the benefits of hearing capital outlay requests in the subcommittee, is that you have the unique advantage of being able to make sure your programmatic and your facility decisions are aligned.",0.0
False,,"So if you do fund enrollment growth, then if there are facility requests related to enrollment growth, you're able to consider those in tandem. There are a few UC requests that are driven based on program expansion, enrollment growth, and again you might want to revisit those after you've made some of your other decisions.",0.0
False,,"You might also find given that these lists can be daunting in terms of all the capital projects that come before you, that you might want some priorities. Do you want to fund life safety projects before program expansions? That could help you identify what you want to do within a segment as well as across the segments. And finally after you've made all these decisions, enrollment growth, operations, COLA, retiree healthcare, facilities, legislature often thinks about how it wants to share those costs.",0.0
False,,"If you turn to page, page 63, you can see that even today, even after the tuition increases that occurred during the recession, all three public segments have relatively low fees when you compare them either to their peer institutions or to other community college systems across the state.",0.0
False,,"And if you turn to page 71, you can see what happens in the state's experience with holding fees flat during economic recovery. Economic recovery is when students' families tend to be fairing better. Their families might be receiving COLAs, again doing generally better obviously than during the recession.",0.0
False,,"And you can see the steep increases in fees during recessions when families tend to be fairing worse. This is the state's experience, so what we've been encouraging the state to think about is after you decide what costs are essential that you think the system is required to both maintain access, to maintain quality, you think about who should bear the costs of those.",0.0
False,,"Should it be entirely the state, or should it be shared? Given the state has state and institutional financial aid programs this tends to be a conversation about should non-needy students, those that don't have financial needs by the way that these programs define them, should they bear any of the extra costs?",0.0
False,,"If their family is doing better, if the state is effectively funding a COLA for the system, should their family be asked to pay a portion of those costs that have been deemed essential for the system? So, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.",0.0
False,,"There's two. Riverside, and...",0.0
False,,You know my colleague might help me.,0.0
False,,"Yes, yes. Well, Paul Golaszewski will give you the right answer.",0.0
False,,"Yes, one can view the universities as, in some ways, when you compare them to all other state agencies in a somewhat advantaged position, because when the state general fund drops during a recession, they can raise raise fees, and given that fees are comparatively low across the country, they can raise them and students still are going to line up and consider it a rather good deal to be able to access the education.",0.0
False,,"Such that when the segments were seeing cuts in the state general fund, they were, to some degree, offset with tuition increases. In addition, if they were financially needy students, they were insulated, they weren't paying the fee increase.",0.0
False,,"That was being covered by the state in the form of Cal Grants. During the recession, tuition and Cal Grants more than doubled, so it was more of a distributional impact on those folks who weren't qualifying for aid, were paying the price. From an institution's perspective, they were a bit better off than some other agencies, because they had this alternative revenue to draw on.",0.0
False,,"When we looked at UC, and you put their student... Their state general fund and their student tuition revenue together, and you compare seven eight with '14 '15, it's down, as I recally, 5%. So, it is still down in per student terms.",0.0
False,,"But, we also looked at it somewhat differently, because UC can access some private money, and other sources of support, which they did increasingly during the recession. So, when you take a somewhat different perspective on how much they spent per student, they were spending a little bit more in '14 '15 than in seven eight.",0.0
False,,"It's sort of an indication of the health of the system. They were able to maintain their program, and actually spent a little bit more per student, post recession, than during the pre-recession years.",0.0
False,,"Yes, and we'd be happy to work with you, because when we do our share of cost numbers, we do count Cal Grants, and I think that we do it without double counting, there's clearly a way that it can be done. So, we'd be happy to work with you to make sure you're getting just the slice of information that you want.",0.0

False,,billion dollars is not spent on the CalWORKS program. It's spent on something else. That's partially why we have a big problem in California.,0.0
False,,"Contrary to the myth that, that family that the maximum family aid for family of two is 670, actually only thirty percent of the caseload",0.0

False,,"Thank you Mr. Bigelow. Department of Finance, do you have anything?",0.0
False,,"I think we've made our thoughts on this matter pretty well known over the years, repeatedly. Particularly on the issue of the timing of these notification, so I don't think we have anything to add at this point.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank you for convenience I should speak since I'm probably the problem child to get us all here today and let.me let me just state I didn't get here to have an audit just off a whim. There were some things were very troubling to me when I first got here and I'm very sensitive to the fact that there have been perceived budget cuts of a billion dollars or more to the court since 2008.",0.0
False,,"However, from my perspective being new here after two years, when I first got here I notice that the Legislature to Governor had pumped quite a bit of money into the courts. I've also assisted in the effort and even though the courts may say they are a billion dollars in a hole, or a billion dollars is being taken away from them.",0.0
False,,We can't forget they got five hundred to six hundred million in CCMS (court case management system). They got another hundred-million from the Legislature in 2013 and I might add in 2013 we gave them one hundred million in my district and they closed a court that helped women who were involved in sex trafficking get off the street.,0.0
False,,"They thought that was a priority to close that instead of trying to help young women who are being victimized in my district every day. We gave another two hundred million to 2014. In the report itself, it calls to question another 386 million in questionable spending, 30 million on cars cell phones and today The Governor has asked that we give the courts another 100 million.",0.0
False,,"From my perspective we've given the court 1.316 billion to 1.4 billion and they still reduce staffing, they still cut courts and they are still crying about another 1.7 billion that was redirected from the court construction funds to core operations and state general funds.",0.0
False,,"From my perspective, there's probably close to two billion dollars that have been pushed into the courts so the Real question is - What the hell did you do that money? What did you do to effectively manage the courts in a way that we did not have to close courts, people did not have to travel a hundred or more Miles to get access to justice?",0.0
False,,"So, as I looked at the core structure, as I sat with several members of my Committee and The auditor about what to audit, I wanted a more comprehensive audit. I wanted audit the construction funds to see if they're being managed properly because billions of dollars that may not be managed properly.",0.0
False,,"What I found is right now is right now The Judicial Court has what I call analysis paralysis. They lead by Committee.  You have a revenue and expenditures Subcommittee six trial court PJ's (presiding judges),",0.0
False,,"7 court executives. You have another trial court Budget Committee Advisory Committee. 15 Trial Court PJ's and 15 court executives. The Judicial Council has 21 voting members including Judiciary, Legislative and State bar participants Another 58 presiding judges and Trial Courts So the real question is - Who is in charge?",0.0
False,,"Like with The Legislature you have to have one person in charge whether that's a speaker, The Governor or The President pro tempore, you cannot lead by Committee. So I'm hoping that with new management that is coming in specifically with Martin Racino that as I try to work with the chief jar two years ago that we finally have someone in place who's going to actually make some critical evaluation of the entire department and come up with some constructive ways that we can move forward.",0.0
False,,"I love the thing that we did with the workload allocation funding model (WAFM) but I am still not comfortable that there's any accountability there seems to be relatively no oversight. And, there's no transparently.",0.0
False,,"And, this audit and the audits that I've looked at that have been done internally within the judicial system basically justifies the status quo. We can no longer manage to courts with the status quo if we do that and expected different result we all know what happens.",0.0
False,,"So I am ecstatic about this audit. I'm happy to hear from the Auditor. I think they've done a remarkable job in the.limited scope that they have, and I'm looking forward to some ways that we can one get accountability, transparency and ultimately that this body can have some type of oversight on how the funds are being moved.",0.0
False,,I understand this whole concept of three branches of government but there's a larger branch of government that hangs over all three branches and that's the people. we manage the people's money and at the end of the day that's tho all three are answering too and we're just vessels for that. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"I have several, but I'll keep it down to a minimum because we have other testimony.",0.0
False,,"I agree with you that we need to work closely with the chief justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, and I apologize for another hyphenated last name person, if I put your name. And Martin Hushino. We need to work together with both of them to effect this change because my question is more of, who really is in charge over there at courts.",0.0
False,,"And I'm not blaming them, I'm blaming more the structure. When you go up through the structure, the presiding judges have a lot of authority. As I mentioned earlier with the closure of the David Kenyon Juvenile Justice system and center in my district, after we gave the local courts 26 million, the next day and immediately closed that.",0.0
False,,"And I know you made a comment, it's about a million dollars and all of the different moneys that are paid to high-level employees, but that could have kept that court open. So it's not just a little money, it's not just a little money to a lot of members here who may have smaller courts where that money could have kept their court open.",0.0
False,,"And so I agree with you that we do have a lot of committees in place there, but I used to be an administrator and I've gone through several audits, I even made an auditor cry one time and I know how to get through this, but also know how to wait it out until after the auditors are gone, the elected officials are gone, and we go back to business as usual, and so I'm really trying to come up with the with a way we can help the existing management there right now.",0.0
False,,"Put in place long-term, sustainable accountability measures, transparency measures, maybe it is auditing every once in a while, but my real question is, do you get a sense of if there's anyone truly in charge, I mean you talk about the Strategic Evaluation Committee report and that counsel coming with some brilliance, some excellent recommendations, but somebody's got to implement them, and if you have no one to implement them, no one to do the carrot and stick to ensure that it gets done in a timely manner, it'll never get done.",0.0
False,,"And I think that might be part of the problem, that there's probably an entrenched group of people within the system that are comfortable with status quo, and so if, one, did you ever get a sense that there's anyone who will actually take the bull by the horn and make these things happen, or is it the function of the different committees and things of that nature, very difficult to really drill down and make some significant changes.",0.0
False,,And if there's anything you could suggest to get us there.,0.0
False,,"Let me just say at the outset, Judge Marsha...is it ""slow'?",0.0
False,,"Sometimes I'm John-Sawyer, you know. But both of you have given me some comfort, a lot of comfort as your predecessors before you have come to me on a budget, and a court, Stephen Jarr, and others, gave me a measure of comfort that you two and the Chief Justice really, really want to make some significant changes.",0.0
False,,"And so I would look at us, the auditors office, the joint legislative Audit Committee, my Committee, as partners in this, and I know sometimes it seems a little difficult, but we're all family. Just think of it like a family argument and we're all family trying to move this along to get to a point where we all want to open up more courts and have more people have access to justice.",0.0
False,,"And if we just start focusing in on that, I think we will ultimately get there, and my question is one of those tools that I want to use or possibly use is this tool that we used today, which is the audit. And in some ways, I will agree, probably in a lot of ways, I will agree with Senator Roth about yes, the magnitude of the money may be very small, but for us it might be a microcosm of culture in the court system and that's really what we're getting to right now, today.",0.0
False,,"And hopefully we can work through that. But one of those tools is an audit, and if we worked, for example, and I'll just put that out there, if we were to also try to find some better ways that the local courts are managed, for example, if we were to find a small court, medium-size court, and the LA county court, that probably would be about 40% of the budget.",0.0
False,,"Which I think would be a significant amount of the budget that we could audit and come up with some ideas on how they can manage better, find some savings, and ultimately maybe find some money so that they can open up, or keep courts open.",0.0
False,,"And so in that respect, there's a discussion about whether or not we do annual audits or every 2 years. I'm more inclined to go every 2 years because I think that this one was done after 2 years and I think it was very important get done and we got a lot of great information that we can now use to help formulate a budget, hopefully help you manage your courts better, but how do you feel about the use of audits for you, so that you can better manage your operations, so the two of you can drill down and find things that, because you don't have to staff to go out there and independently look at things, you now have that as a tool for you.",0.0
False,,"So 1 year, 2 years, semi annual audits...Don't give me that audit face.",0.0
False,,"And, just real quick, I've reviewed the audits that have been done internally and they're watching in a lot of ways, and so I recommend you look at them.",0.0
False,,"And I look at audits a little bit differently and we're going to bring this within my Subcommittee, subcommittee five later on, to talk about this.",0.0
False,,"Audis aren't necessarily bad. If the Auditor comes and brings an audit to sub five that basically says you need to increase the budget by X amount, and the functions that this money needs to go is ABC and we get our buckets, that's a much stronger argument for us to legitimately give you money and we have an outside independent Auditor saying that you need money, you need money for these different categories, so I don't necessarily always look at it as a bad thing.",0.0
False,,"In some ways, I look at as a way to validate why you need money, and most important, how much you need, and how quickly you need it, so I wouldn't just get all negative and everything about audits, but this could be a great way to help the judicial system. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"I do want to thank you for allowing us to be on this dice today and most important, just to remind everybody, budget sub five will be looking at the audit and recommendations, and if we can maybe even use some budget language to institutionalize some of this so that we can move forward and ensure that accountability, access to justice, transparency, all those things that have been discussed today, we hopefully will be able to do it through the budget process.

False,,"Thank you. Good afternoon and Thank you Chairman Beall and Chairman Wieckowski, senator and members of the Committee for having me and for accommodating my lovely ski accident that I'm recovering from.",0.0
False,,"I kind of forgot that I was not twenty and I was fifty eight. So, thank you for having me. I'm Catherine Reheis-Boyd and I represent the Western States Petroleum Association.",0.0
False,,"And our Association for those of you who are not familiar, hopefully you are, but we make-up the state's major oil producers and refineries that",0.0
False,,"are responsible for nearly one hundred percent of all the gasoline, diesel, jet fuel sold in the State of California.",0.0
False,,"So we have I think a unique perspective to bring today and, hopefully, a contribution to make to this discussion.",0.0
False,,And I'm so glad to hear that my friends at the auto industry also have some concerns to express today.,0.0
False,,"Our refiners, I think you know who they are, Chevron, Tesoro, Valero, Shell, Philips 66 and Exxon Mobil.",0.0
False,,They are the focus of many of the state's climate change policies. We certainly are in the stationary source of cap and trade we are in the transportation fuels under the cap and trade,0.0
False,,We're in the low carbon fuel standard. So we are and we have the honor of being in many buckets here in this conversation.,0.0
False,,"But, it's also really important to understand that at the same time we are holding the serious responsibility of supplying adequate reliable fuels to the marketplace.",0.0
False,,And I want to get into that a little bit. It requires us to do that every day 365 days a year.,0.0
False,,"I think, we've talked before about California's transportation fuel market being the third-largest feel market in the world, as a state.",0.0
False,,"And, the only two that are in front of us are the United States of America and China.",0.0
False,,"So, it's a large large market. Your constituents and our customers drive twenty six million cars and over one million medium and heavy-duty trucks.",0.0
False,,That requires thirteen billion gallons of gasoline three-point-five billion gallons of diesel every day.,0.0
False,,"And, that's as we sit here that's two million gallons of fuel every hour of every day.",0.0
False,,We say that just to put this into perspective when we talk about going towards 2020 and post 2020.,0.0
False,,"So the need for reliable transportation fuels in California is enormous and, the benefits for reliable mobility for families and businesses in this discussion is critical.",0.0
False,,"So, a primary concern for our refineries as we evaluate these proposals and these fuel policies is really the potential impact this has on fuels for the state.",0.0
False,,Now we recognize that the state certainly has the most aggressive climate change goals and they intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.,0.0
False,,that is not at debate and we don't question that. But as decision-makers I know you are appreciative of the mobility needs of the public and we have to consider these policies not only in,0.0
False,,their contribution to the state's climate change goals but also to their potential impacts on the fuel supplies.,0.0
False,,Obviously the state has deserved a reputation as a leader when it comes to innovative public policies. But when we look at the rest of the world and where they are going it,0.0
False,,"appears they are heavily relying and this is,a lot of what is being talked on the road Paris, is really policies that are relying on market mechanisms like the cap and trade program.",0.0
False,,That's what everybody's talking about. That's what's going to encourage reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.,0.0
False,,And not conversations on what we call here complementary policies that we think can be confusing costly and potentially contradictory like the low carbon fuel standard.,0.0
False,,I am in a bit of disagreement with my other peers at the table on this topic. Policies like the low carbon fuel standard attempt to set sector specific targets,0.0
False,,that really limit the flexibility to achieve the larger goals that we think not only California's after but the rest of the world is talking about.,0.0
False,,"So, if California wants others to follow its lead we think it's essential to increase the emphasis on the cost-effective marketplace policies rather than policies aimed at specific economic sectors of the economy.",0.0
False,,Now you've talked about today a suite of these regulatory programs that are already in place that are designed to aggressively force development and deployment of alternative fuels and technologies.,0.0
False,,As well as drive fundamental changes in land use. Most of these aggressive policies certainly are in the early stages of implementation.,0.0
False,,"So, there is obviously some uncertainty exists with the fuel supplies whether the manufacturers can actually do it or local governments can comply with it.",0.0
False,,But that being said achieving the necessary emission reductions in the transportation sector to meet the California's climate change goal,0.0
False,,really is focused right now on reducing vehicle travel in sb 375. You've got establishing this the fuel efficiency being talked about in the ARB's Advanced Clean Cars Program.,0.0
False,,The heavy-duty vehicle greenhouse gas regulations. You certainly are taking a very active role in deploying advanced technology vehicles that operate on electricity and hydrogen in the zero emission vehicle program.,0.0
False,,"Which obviously, we've discussed has its challenges but all of us were also there to support AB-8 and getting hydrogen stations being located in the state. Using alternative fuels is very prominent in these regulations.",0.0
False,,"You've got high-level ethanol blend, you've got natural gas from noble natural gas drop-in replacement fuels, renewal gasoline and diesel all of these are very very prominent in all of the existing regulations that we're talking about to achieve all of the goals that we are talking about.",0.0
False,,In addition as you all know as of January one 2015 fuels have been brought under the cap and trade program. And  so CARB's cap and trade program and now they're subject to a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions.,0.0
False,,So this cap is enforceable and it will ensure greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels do not exceed the amount permitted by CARB.,0.0
False,,So of the many policies we have in place today the purpose of meeting the California's climate goals some are intended to reduce the demand for petroleum fuels but others will negatively impact the supply of petroleum fuels.,0.0
False,,We're really making this clarification on focus policies that are on the demand side and not on the ones that can have a negative impacts on the supply-side.,0.0
False,,"So demand side policies we think are the preferred option to look at going forward. The improved vehicle efficiencies, the focus on land use planning including investments in public transportation.",0.0
False,,Those are more likely to meet the state's climate change goals without compromising the reliability of supply of transportation fuels for families and businesses throughout the state.,0.0
False,,So in contrast to the demand side policies there's a low carbon fuel standard this is a prime example of a supply-side policy it impacts the reliability of transportation fuels and we think it should be reevaluated.,0.0
False,,"It was adopted in 2007, it's half-way through its ten-year compliance period as the Committee's background paper notes the low carbon fuel standard requires a ten percent reduction in carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in California by 2020.",0.0
False,,"But that carbon intensity reduction as, you know, has been frozen at one percent since 2013. So, early in the impact of this regulation as we look to a ten percent as we come out of this freeze at one percent.",0.0
False,,"So in fact, the compliance with low carbon fuel standard is really by ethanol blending and most of the credit sixty percent of them are generated under the program from that.",0.0
False,,The ARB's compliance scenario for 2014 assumed that a hundred million gallons of low ci sugar cane from ethanol from Brazil would be available in the California marketplace.,0.0
False,,So they assumed a hundred-million gallons. In 2014 three million gallons were sold in California. So the program is not seeing at this point in time it's anticipated investments and subsequent commercial availability of these low CI fuels.,0.0
False,,Particularly as we all know in the cellulosic biofuel area. So we think this program on the supply-side it really does rely heavily on fuels and technologies that are not commercially available.,0.0
False,,"And therefore there potentially will have an impact on supply of conventional fuels to the public. Again, we really think the emphasis should be on the demand side policies that many of which have been discussed today in which we totally support.",0.0
False,,So we do encourage serious review of the low carbon fuel standard before 2017. We will be coming out of the one percent freeze in 2016 and the complies schedule is aggressive going forward.,0.0
False,,We really think that program needs to be looked at from as Chairman Beall noted from a cost-effectiveness standpoint where does it fall in when we look at and how close we are already meeting the fifty percent reduction goals.,0.0
False,,So in conclusion while the transportation sector certainly accounts for forty percent of the greenhouse gas emissions and we understand that has to be addressed.,0.0
False,,"There are numerous policies in place today in the cap and trade program, in transportation fuels under the cap and trade program to ensure we meet these goals. and we encourage you again to thoroughly review these existing programs.",0.0
False,,I kind of always like to know where I am before I decide where I'm going. So kind of really looking at where we are with the existing programs and then deciding what that path forward looks like.,0.0
False,,"Some you will find are performing well some are not performing as expected and some are expensive and inefficient. So we would resist a let's throw it all in the basket, let's do all of the above until we kind of look at a rank and see where we are and how close we are.",0.0
False,,And then what we need to do to fill the gap. We encourage again to incorporate evaluation of the policies on how they're impacting consumers and how consumers can be protected.,0.0
False,,There's a lot being done in the electricity and natural gas side of the cap and trade program to protect consumers and we think we need to look at our industry as well.,0.0
False,,"We also note from your questions on the coordination between Committees very happy that the CEC formed petroleum market Advisory Committee they've been having quite a few meetings,",0.0
False,,"and I encourage you to have them come in and talk to you also because they're looking at all of these fuel policies. And, they have indicated they want additional resources to delve into the examination of the impact of climate policies on fuel markets and consumers.",0.0
False,,a great wonderful of the input CRM.,0.0
False,,"That I think will be a very good discussion. So, I would say going forward, and our members, be clear on the goals, focus on demand side policies many of which we've talked about.",0.0
False,,"Be sure that the existing and propose policies don't compromise the reliable supply of conventional fuels for the public. Because that, you know, those gallons are huge.",0.0
False,,"And if you are not prepared to replace them, the program will be set back and that's not what anybody wants to have happen.",0.0
False,,"so make sure the agencies are coordinating. It's very important that everybody's in alignment on the policy and strategic goals that have been mentioned and,",0.0
False,,"again, we just we need to rely on petroleum fuels for a very significant part of the transportation future that's going to be with us for a very long-time far longer than any of these horizons we're talking about here.",0.0
False,,So let's just make sure we bring some more realistic expectations to the conversation as we figure out what we're going to go post 2020. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Good morning Chair and Members. Caliph Assagai on behalf of the California Public Defenders Association. We did submit an opposed letter to the Committee.,0.0
False,,"We've since met with the office and have an agreement to work out our issue, which has to do with identifying which warrant should be considered the original.",0.0
False,,"We're sure we'll come to a resolution, but I just want to acknowledge that we did oppose and we have worked with the author to address our issues. Thank You.",0.0
False,,Caliph Assagai with the California Public Defenders Association in support.,0.0
False,,Caliph Assagai with the California Public Defenders Association we were opposed to this measure based on a jurisdiction issue that has since been resolved with Judicial Council and Assembly Member Obernolte. We appreciate your willingness to work with us and we're no longer opposed.,0.0
False,,"Caliph Assagai with the California Public Defenders Association we are opposed this measure. This can already be charged as a misdemeanor, and we don't think they'll be a deterrent effect by increasing it to a felony.",0.0
False,,"Furthermore, these are the petitions already filed under penalty of perjury. So while we understand what the Assembly woman is trying to accomplish with this, we don't think it adds anything to this area of law. So we're opposed.",0.0
False,,"And that we're working towards better coordination pathway development for students. Thank you, you'll be hearing from a number of our folks, today's their ledge day here at the Capitol, as they'll be wearing those blue buttons as supporting K-12 adult education. So, appreciate the time. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Good morning members, I'm Lizette Everett, on behalf the Community College League of California. I want to thank if your time, and also thank the Governor for allocating $500 million to adult education. We do have a couple of concerns moving forward, one of them being the incorporation of the coming college non-credit funds into the Adult Education Block Grant.",0.0
False,,"These, aforementioned earlier by Donna Burns, these are planes that go into the education of both non-credit and credit in terms of integrated learning. The other is the concern of the lack of a data interface, a state-wide one. As you heard from many students, they don't care who's providing their adult education, they care that they can transition to both, and they can move on into the workforce or careers, and that's really important in a system moving forward.",0.0
False,,"Lastly, as you'll see from a lot of organizations here, there's a coalition really pushing that we have local consortium accountability plans that are--allow for really the analysis of needs, but also really take into consideration the dynamics of working together and  building on that existing collaboration. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Good morning, yes still morning. Judy Heimen, Legislative Analyst's office. The sergeant has distributed a handout that covers both of these next two items on your agenda I'll provide some brief background on Career Pathways Program, followed by our analysis and recommendations.",0.0
False,,"The purpose of this program is to improve career pathways which are sequences of courses in programs often beginning with career exploration in middle school, continuing with courses in high school that combine rigorous academics along with career preparation.",0.0
False,,"The courses are articulated with local community colleges and four-year institutions and the pathway process typically involves regional employers, labor organizations and other stakeholders to make sure that students are prepared for the work force.",0.0
False,,"The states CTE Pathways Program provides grants to consortia that must include at least one community college and one school district working together to help regions develop not just the pathways themselves, but also policies and collaborations that will support these pathways.",0.0
False,,The current program replaced an earlier version that ran from 2005 to 2013 and provided nearly four hundred million dollars over that eight-year period. The new program was funded in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 at forty-eight million dollars each and is scheduled to sunset June 30th of this year.,0.0
False,,"Yes, this is the last year and the Department of Education and the Chancellors office jointly allocate funding to projects and just to give you an idea of some of the types of projects that they fund, one grant is to continue developing model CTE course lessons that are posted on a website for sharing curricula among providers.",0.0
False,,"Another grant is for developing internship and other work-based learning opportunities for students and a third is to provide professional development on best practices for CTE providers. As Mr. Nuzam explained, the Governor's proposing to extend the grant program for an additional year and our assessment of that proposal begins on page four.",0.0
False,,"As my colleague discussed in the last panel, providing additional categorical funding for CTE further fragments the states workforce funding. The state school funding approach and increasingly it's approach to post-secondary education, relies more on accountability for outcomes rather than dedicated funding that's tied to specific activities.",0.0
False,,Extending a categorical program beyond statutory sunset would be a step in the opposite direction and for that reason we recommend that you reject the Governor's proposal to extend this program for an additional year.,0.0

False,,"Wasn't a question, I was going to move the bill, so I move the bill with the additional provisal that I will work with the author of the bill to find innovative ways to find funding.",0.0
False,,"And in fact anything that we propose that produces any kind of unforeseen economic problem to any entity, I think that the state basically is on the hook for it anyway, and so as it moves out, and your biggest challenge may be getting it out of Aprops, but I will work with you and the Chair of the Committee that handles that, so we can possibly  find a funding source, so it doesn't die an untimely death in Appropriations somewhere.",0.0
False,,"And I'd like to move the bill, I want to thank Mr. Stone for bringing this forward,",0.0
False,,"and I know you and I've been working on this for, ever since we got to the Assembly. We've had this carrot and stick approach to prisons and we use more stick than carrot, and I think at some point we've got to provide avenues in which people are allowed to improve their lives, and learn different habits than they have with the stick approach.",0.0
False,,"When I see this gentleman who sits in front of me, who's out of prison, and has not been in prison for several years, yes I see a man, I see someone that's turned his life around, but as someone who's part of budget, and the Chair of Budget Sub 5, I also see some someone that's not a cost or burden to the state to fifty thousand-dollars a year.",0.0
False,,"Which means he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the general fund, hundreds of million of dollars that can go back to programming for other people who want to get out, but most important that probably will exceed what we need, and we can also use that for schools, for roads, and other things,",0.0
False,,"and so this approach of allowing people to retrain them, to learn different habits through the various programs, I applaud you on that, and I'm going to, obviously, I put in the motion, but I'm also going to vote for this today and in hope that we continue this venue.",0.0
False,,"I've always said: out of a hundred and thirty thousand prisoners, people who are incarcerated, if we just took about twenty-two hundred of them, at fifty thousand dollars a year, we could save the state about eleven billion dollars over a ten year period, and we should really start thinking in those terms about the number of people who don't recidivate how much money we can bring back to our state coffers. So I applaud you on this effort.",0.0
False,,"I will take them in numerical order, starting with AB 672, the Inmate Reentry Assistance.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members. AB 672 requires CDCR to provide transitional services to wrongfully convicted individuals upon their release from prison. Over the last two decades, the number of exonerated in the United States has nearly tripled every year.",0.0
False,,"After spending decades in prison for crimes they didn't commit, wrongfully committed convicted persons are released back into the community without access to basic transitional services such as housing assistance, job training, or drug rehabilitation.",0.0
False,,"Simply put, this bill will provide access to the same services that parollees are able to receive upon release from custody. Here today to testify in support is Obie Anthony and Ignacio Hernandez, who is representing the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice.",0.0
False,,"In 2011, Mr. Anthony, after being wrongfully convicted, was released from detention after spending seventeen years in prison. Mr. Anthony was the inspiration of this bill. He was released from prison with nothing but his clothes and a few dollars in his pocket. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,The Earned Compliance Credit and Reinvestment.,0.0

False,,"Rosa Aqeel, PICO California, a proud sponsor, in support of the bill.",0.0
False,,"Okay I'll have Glenn, but, I just wanted to quickly say, the real premise of this and, when we talk about supervision, the way we've been doing it now, 74% of people recidivate, so obviously to continue to go down the path to the way we're doing now is not working and we need to provide funding.",0.0
False,,"What really got me inspired to do this is to get funding to create a different path or pathway for people to reduce their amount time in prison but also gain some skills using the funding that I've been saying all along since I've been in the Legislature that we need to help people get out reduce the time that they're in prison and then use that money as savings to create a system where they can get drug rehabilitation, get education, and I think this methodology that we're using now will ultimately create a different methodology for supervision.",0.0

False,,Southern California Edison will achieve 33% renewable energy by 2020 and we can support a broader framework for achieving the 2030 goals. One that looks at integrating renewable energy--much more renewable energy--with energy efficiency and transportation electrification.,0.0
False,,We think that with regard to meeting the and exceeding the state's twenty-three goals going forward and going toward 2050 much more renewable energy is required but we really need to look at all of the tools in the toolbox.,0.0
False,,Utility discoverable renewables are important but distributed generation is equally important as is getting the utility significantly invested in the transportation electrification.,0.0

False,,"That is changing and, we this bill serves to be ready when the economy comes back fully and we're ready to find a new CSU that we have the actual data of where the greatest needs are in order to be able to use our money most effectively.",0.0
False,,So since defending of the California post-secondary education Commission in two thousand eleven we have not had a coordinating body to be able to do this type of work.,0.0
False,,So without having that coordinating body we don't have good concrete data from which to make our decisions. We know that we're going to have at least in two thousand and fifteen forty-one percent of California should have a higher education college degree.,0.0
False,,To be able to obtain the kinds of jobs that will be available and right now they only have about thirty five million. We have at least a million shortfall right now and that is going to continue to grow especially as a population continues to grow.,0.0

False,,"But I chose public service like many of us around here and I'm concerned about the privatization of the UC and CSU and the Community College Systems; that we're looking at money, that's the number one factor in how we move forward, the fact that there's a very small group of individuals that make decisions on the budget they're making over five hundred-thousand-dollars that may be more connected to the state budget, than they are with anything else.",0.0
False,,"They're the ones that I'm really concerned with, and how do you change that behavior. You have individuals right now who are very similar to what I'm dealing with the judiciary. There's a small group of individuals in the AOC who make more than Governor, but they make one hundred-percent of the budget decisions that go on, and we find it a lot of the decisions were not in the best interest of the people, and people access to justice, but more important they weren't looking at how to do efficiencies in a way where they didn't need all the money that they claim to need, which is like one-point-two billion dollars. They probably need a whole lot less if they were a little more efficient, but they didn't care in some cases, they didn't care about how to do that in an efficient manner.",0.0
False,,"Right now, you have a game we're going with the UCs, with the people who are making this kind of capital. Where out-of-state students are on a premium for going out of systems, you can pay a premium or more important the students here. if I were them, if they wanted to really be a business enterprise, I would not have said we're going to cap out-of-state students to pay a whole lot of money at two thousand, and keep the in-state-students at one thousand. I would have made a great deal with the money that we would have made off of that, that brought that number to two thousand and anybody, you, me, and everybody in the Assembly and the Senate jumping up and down but instead, we're playing the pun games with people who make this kind of salary on the tuition, on the employees within the system, tuition hikes gone back as a pawn between this body and the UC and they just, like the judiciary say, almost act like we're almost like the third branch of government and the Assembly and others can't tell us.",0.0
False,,"One way we can actually impact this is through the budget, so I applaud you for coming at it through the pocketbook because that is a lot of ways to only you can make people perk up, and then like the lasting that really bothers me is when, and I'm not trying to put UCLA on blast right now, because obviously as I told my colleague from UCLA I would love to make sure UCLA football coach only made a hundred-thousand-dollars a year.",0.0
False,,"And then you would only be able to get a high school coach-to-coach and but that's a whole of the discussion, but the number of African-American students that are being admitted right now into the UC's is abysmal, and I don't feel, there's right now that, there's a real concerted effort to do that. Yes, the UC spent twenty million dollars a year to get minority students into the system, there has been another five million to go international, but, but they are able to be more successful with the five million than with the twenty. That's management, those are the people that are making all these, the people who make the decisions and they're not doing things. I think we're in a best interests, so I think this effort you're doing now looking at the perks, compensations, retirement, housing, employer paid compensation will probably shed a light because I call this the Marie Antoinette kind of analogy, where people at the top who make the decision cannot have this attitude to let them eat cake in hope that they ultimately will get what they want.",0.0
False,,"Whether not doing it a hundred-million or any, before we give the UC any money we need to make sure that they're using the money properly to do what the people of California really want done, so I'm one of those they're very cautious sitting on budget, the Budget Committee about how we move forward from this day forward, so I applaud you on this, I was still a little skeptical because I'm still unsure whether or not they will get the message before that you see for wake up and understand that the Assembly, the Senate, and the Governor very serious about that.

False,,"Madame Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association Advocates. I do want to point out in a way, this is friendly opposition, because Senator Hill has been very gracious to spend a lot of time with us talking about this issue.",0.0
False,,"It's unfortunate that we still remain opposed to the bill. And it's for two very practical reasons. First, I do want to point out that Senator Hill has actually done a bang-up job in his district, in making it clear to his school board, San Mateo Unified, and the people in his community, that he doesn't think that they handled this situation in the best manner possible.",0.0
False,,"And we've always thought, since this issue was first brought to us last fall, that this is an issue best handled at the local level. As we've seen before in other bills where we have a discrete problem in a small area, fixing it with a state-wide fix creates complications in other parts of the state.",0.0
False,,"So on one hand, one example is that different school districts handled the Prop 39 decision about an offer differently. Oakland Unified handles it much like San Mateo, which is, staff makes the presentation to the board, and the board acts on it as San Mateo did.",0.0
False,,"Los Angeles Unified, because they have so many Prop 39 requests, has made a point to shift the responsibility to the superintendent. So the superintendent makes the offer, the board does not take action on that offer. And there's no requirement that they do.",0.0
False,,"And in Los Angeles, that's important, because they get 80 to 100 Prop 39 requests every year. Can you imagine an LAUSD school board meeting, as infrequently as they really happen, having to deal with eight or nine Prop 39 requests at every hearing? Those school board meetings would become Prop 39 meetings. There would be no time to do anything else.",0.0
False,,"The other issue that we have from our standpoint is: the law is very prescriptive, both in terms of the statute, the regulations, as well as case law that's devleoped over the last fourteen years. That prescriptive law limits the amount of discretion that a school district has relative to meeting the definition of ""reasonably equivalent.""",0.0
False,,"Having public hearings and public comment and all that leads the public to assume that there is something else that can be done. That there is discretion at the school board level about which location they can offer to a charter school. And that, in most cases, is just not the case because of the prescription of the law.",0.0
False,,"We don't want to create a situation where there are more upset people because they expect to get something out of a public hearing that they're not going to get, and we certainly don't want to turn LAUSD and other school districts into just a conveyor of Prop 39 requests.",0.0
False,,"And we do think that Senator Hill has been very effective and think that that effort should return to the district, and hopefully San Mateo will be more transparent in the process in the future. For these reasons, we have to oppose the bill. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to clarify two things real quick. One, this is very much an administrative process because it is, so much expertise is necessary to do this that you can't really leave it up to sort of a policy 30,000 foot-level debate.",0.0
False,,"And I do want to correct one thing the Senator said relative to discretion, it is actually the issue of discretion about the location that is, it's hard to have any discretion. When you're talking about number of classrooms, you're talking about square footage, you're talking about all the amenities of the facility in order to accommodate the students. There are very few places in most school districts that would meet the very specific requirements of the offer that has to be made under Proposition 39.",0.0
False,,"Yeah if I may, Madame Chair, Senator Pan, and I appreciate the question.",0.0
False,,"Absolutely, through the chair. What Senator Hill is describing is a discrete situation in his district. And yes there may have been options, but my understanding, and Ms. Kollman may be able to expand on this further 'cause she actually represented the charter school in that situation, Design Tech, is that the location of the school was something that needed to happen quickly, right away, so they could open the school and get things going.",0.0
False,,"The other options were not options that were available. The co-location at Mills High School was always intended to be temporary. And as we understand it, in the next school year, they are expected to be someplace else.",0.0
False,,"And everybody knew that going into it, that this was gonna be the case. But the options that Senator Hill is talking about were not available to the school district at the time that the school needed to be open. They couldn't wait another year or two for other location possibilities.",0.0
False,,"I mean, it does underscore the fact that every school district is different, every school district is gonna have a different set of circumstances, and unfortunately most of them are not gonna have options even a couple years down the road, because the facilities in the school district are very limited, especially in terms of meeting those very specific requirements for square footage and classroom and all that kinda stuff.",0.0
False,,"Madam chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Afterschool Coalition. I really appreciate the description of the program that Senator Hancock has given.

We do want to point out that this is a problem that flows from Proposition 49 which we are grateful for but has created a box that's been very hard for us to get out of.",0.0
False,,"That initiative had a dollar amount in it, 550 million dollars, which was great at the time but it has stayed at 550 million dollars since it was enacted in 2002. And there has been no increase in that amount of money. What it's created, plus the statutory requirements of the program, it's created a box that after school programs have difficulty getting out of in terms of their finances.",0.0
False,,And Senator Hancock has mentioned things like the two minimum wage increases. We also have the sick leave change in the law that was enacted last year that requires us to have at least three days of sick leave for each of our employees.,0.0
False,,"Those are all costs that are real costs to the program that we don't have the capacity to budget our way out of to reduce programs, to even raise revenue. So what we're seeking is just as an increase to the 550 million dollars that would accommodate the two minimum wage increases.",0.0
False,,We're not even asking for all the costs. The 17% increase in the CPIs since 2006 is cost of doing business that we have to accommodate and we have to find a way to budget but we're not asking for that. We simply want the two minimum wage increases.,0.0
False,,The reality is the programs are going to get squeezed out of existence if there is not a way of finding relief. We cannot cut ourselves out of it because every time you want to reduce a staff member you have to reduce 20 students.,0.0
False,,"And you're then losing the 20 students worth of ADA. So your revenue loss ends up exceeding whatever you're going to save by cutting a staff person. You cannot, because of the population we serve, ask for parents to pay a portion of the fee.",0.0
False,,82% of our programs are serving people of free and reduced lunch eligibility. That's a lot of families that can't afford $10 a week or any amount to help offset the cost. And we're also already providing by statute 33% in kind or other revenue coming from outside the state.,0.0
False,,"It's a real box that we've got to find our way out of. We know this is also a budget issue but the bill does carry an escalator for future years so we don't find ourselves in this position year in and year out and would allow the department of education to increase it according to the CPI in future years. We ask for your support, thank you.",0.0

False,,"All right, 11 against 1. I like those odds. Mr. Chairman, members, Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans.",0.0
False,,"Regrettably we do oppose, AB 1162. We believe this bill will increase costs to the state by requiring Medi-Cal managed care plans to pay for tobacco cessation drugs in a manner that, that is inconsistent with the Department of Health Care Services policy and sound medical management.",0.0
False,,"To be sure health plans strongly support the importance of aiding individuals in tobacco cessation, and we recognize a staggering economic impact in the human consequences of smoking.",0.0
False,,"That is why the department requires Medi-Cal plans to cover the panoply of tobacco cessation drugs, but with reasonable medical management such as prior authorization under certain circumstances.",0.0
False,,"Unfortunately we do have several concerns with the bill. Number one, the measure requires medical managed care plans to cover all cessation, medications approved by the FDA.",0.0
False,,"And correspondingly, eliminates prior authorization requirements for these drug treatments and this provision alone, we believe is bad public policy. Some tobacco cessation drugs are not safe for all people a very popular tobacco cessation drug, for instance, is known to cause a whole host of side effects including, including suicidal behavior.",0.0
False,,"It's a great drug for many people, but for some folks, it does not work and can be dangerous. Indeed, the FDA in 2013 linked this particular drug to over 500 suicides over a five year period.",0.0
False,,"As a result, some plans do put that particular drug on the prior authorization list. So when we analyze a bill like this we do have to ask ourselves whether my member plans are being asked to pay for the wrong care at the wrong time for the wrong people.",0.0
False,,And we believe this bill opens the door for that and therefore we have to object. We also object to the language that further delinks counseling from the tobacco cessation drugs.,0.0
False,,"My member plans believe that counseling sessions are an important part of tobacco cessation therapy, and can enhance pharmaceutical therapies and maximizes, maximize the chance of quitting.",0.0
False,,The data clearly shows that patients that receive assistance from a clinician are two to three times more likely to to quit smoking for at least five months or more.,0.0
False,,"So, plans in the commercial market or in public programs are expected to be good stewards of either premiums or state funds. There's no provision here requiring the Department of Health Care Service to adjust the reimbursement rate to health plans for the enhanced benefit.",0.0
False,,So while we do strongly support the intent of the bill we must vigorously defend the management of formularies if the cost of this benefit is to remain affordable to the state. So for those reasons we respectfully oppose the bill. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Mm-hm.,0.0
False,,Right.,0.0
False,,Yeah.,0.0
False,,"Well, thank you assembly member. We're not gonna be able to be supportive of a bill that moves, that eliminates prior authorization. Particularly for a drug category that has known harmful side effects.",0.0
False,,"In indeed the Department of Health Care Services policy letter on this issue which is the, instructs the medical managed care plans does require the coverage of all seven types of medications, but it says that only one has to be available without prior authorization.",0.0
False,,"I think that's in recognition to some of the issues that I addressed in my primary testimony. So, you know, my initial thought here is that if his author and his staff were willing to sit down and talk about conforming the bill to the DHCS policy letter, I think we could find some constructive things to talk about. That, that, that would be our preference.",0.0
False,,"If there was, if there was, conformity, that may or may not, that may address our concerns. Of course, I have to consult with my members.",0.0
False,,I have 43 member health plans.,0.0
False,,43. Got it. Yeah so yeah with the majority of which do participate in the medical program and are proud of that. That might be a place where we could at least start discussions. But at this point the bill does not conform to that guidance.,0.0
False,,"That is correct, yeah.",0.0
False,,It is currently being offered to the MediCal population. What this bill does is remove prior authorization from the delivery of those drugs.,0.0
False,,Yes it does.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, it, in, in, in, it, as... I stated in my testimony, there in, in particular there is one drug with, potential very harmful side effects that some plans do put on prior auth.",0.0
False,,"And that, that'll be deployed if you know, those side effects will be relative for that particular patient, but, but, yeah, it is something that is used in the private sector as well.",0.0
False,,"The Department of Healthcare Services requires the coverage of tobacco cessation drugs. The our issue is that it, it this is different than the policy that has been issued by the state and in, in, in a way that we think is harmful so.",0.0

False,,We'll take a look at those amendments and let the author know whether our position has changed. Again the problem with the existing bill is similar to the bill that Mr.,0.0
False,,"Holden had before the committee in that it removes prior authorization allowance for Medi-Cal managed care plans, on a drug which is oftentimes prescribed for off label use, and that may not be appropriate for all patients.",0.0

False,,"Yeah to you, to your comment similar to Member Chavez, I think one, one of the pieces of misinformation that is getting out there is that drug prices are not on the rise.",0.0
False,,"And you know, obviously as the payers in the health care system we are very concerned about cost increases in the system.",0.0
False,,"And we'll just say that, the Assemblymember, Assemblymember Chiu mentioned this is in his testimony, but if you look at the top 100 drugs by sales, in 2010, only 26% of those, were $10,000 a year, or per patient I should say.",0.0
False,,"Pardon me. In 2014, that's increased to 47% of those top 100 drugs. So they, they are on the rise. And, and indeed, in, in those four years that price increase and that category increase by 750%.",0.0
False,,"So so, so we are concerned about the trend. We are concerned the tu-, pipeline. There are about 11 or 12 drugs that are going to be introduced or approved I should say by the FDA, that are in the blockbuster category.",0.0
False,,"And then, based on a, an actually, an old analysis, this may be different now, the drugs are actually 14 percent of the premiu, the premium dollar, not 10.",0.0
False,,"I would, with your indulgence, Mr. Chair, I just have to would like to offer to come in and talk to Assemblymember Maienschein and Assemblywoman Waldron about our position on SB-46. I think there's some misinformation that's being delivered on that bill.",0.0
False,,"We opposed that bill because, the information that was provided by the plans, triggered a specific regulatory action, on the plans. It wasn't a pure transparency bill from our perspective.",0.0
False,,We removed our opposition to a follow up Leno bill when it was distilled down to a transparency bill between employer purchasers and labor trusts and the health plan.,0.0

False,,"Nick Louizos, California Association of Health Plans, opposed.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair Members, Rand Martin, on behalf of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation I appreciate the summary that that Mr. Nizarian has provided. He actually took half my testimony away from me, but one statistic I do want to point out was that he had not included, is the the fact that despite the fact that we believe that we, if you read the press, that we have control of this epidemic.",0.0
False,,"There are still 5,000 new infections in California alone every single year. That really does indicate that we are far from in control of this of this epidemic. And the reason we're not is because there are populations that are increasingly hard to get to.",0.0
False,,"AHF happens to be the largest provider, as I indicated in testimony on another bill, but we're also the largest tester in the state of California. We did 50,000 tests, last year. We did 3 million tests worldwide last year. So we know the experience, that testing provides.",0.0
False,,"And testing is the answer to controlling the epidemic. Research demonstrates that if people know that they're HIV positive they will change their behaviors and they will voluntarily access care and treatment. So if we can get people tested, if we can get them in to places where testing occurs, we know that will happen.",0.0
False,,We test in a lot of different places. We even have mobile vans that go out to Target shopping centres. And down the street from dance clubs at 3 o'clock in the morning. But the last major institution where testing is not routinely happening is the emergency department.,0.0

False,,"We've done everything we possibly can, short of dropping the bill altogether to try and, eliminate as much of the burden as we possibly can, so that it is a far more routine and far less burdensome, effort in the emergency department.",0.0
False,,"We think it's important to get ahead of this epidemic, we think this is a really good way of doing that, and we ask for your support.",0.0
False,,"And, and, and Mr. Waldron, I simply like to add that we, we've been very careful in this bill not to be prescriptive. We set the overarching policy. But it's up to the hospital to figure how best to do that. And I think that the first thing that they will do is make sure that the emergency is taken care of first. We're not telling them that they have to do anything in one order or another.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, if, if, if you don't mind.",0.0
False,,"I do want to point out. I appreciate the study, and the, and the study is helpful. The study is also in an environment in which HIV testin, testing is very, very prevalent. There's a lot of testing that goes on in San Francisco. So finding smaller numbers in San Francisco is not surprising.",0.0
False,,"The research, and the statistics that the department of public health has on HIV, indicate that some of the worst places are places that are less urban. The more rural areas, the other urban centers that are not in San Francisco or Los Angeles, are actually seeing higher numbers of people who are testing late for HIV.",0.0
False,,"They're already coming down with symptoms of AIDS before they even get an HIV test. And it's those populations that we really need to get to. And the other population is Mr. Ridley-Thomas has pointed out, even an urban center, center like Los Angeles, a lot of communities of color are at very high risk, are not engaged in healthcare. And they find the place to get all their healthcare is still in the emergency department. Very important to get to those people as well.",0.0
False,,"Sure. There's, there's always going to be a population that uses emergency rooms that does not have any coverage and we appreciate that. And I think that we can continue to work on that issue. There, there, Medi-Cal, Medicare and private health now cover HIV testing in the hospital emergency department.",0.0
False,,"There are funds available through the Office of AIDS to pay and through county health departments, to pay for testing for people who do not have coverage anywhere else. Those are funds that hospital emergency departments could take advantage of as well.",0.0
False,,"So we can continue to close that gap so that almost everybody who walks through can pay. And yeah, there are people who can be private pay as well. The te, the cost of the test is actually not that much. It's less than $40.",0.0
False,,"I'm not sure what the hospitals might add to that, but, but the cost of the test is actually pretty, pretty, pretty small for those, who, who could do private pay. I also wanna make one other point relative to the testing sensitivity. The, the, the h, rapid HIV test is 99.7%, sensitive, which means that 99.7% it's right.",0.0
False,,"So, yeah, there are false positives, but they are very, very small numbers. And, yes, that's why we do confirmatory testing, but very few w, confirmatory tests will change the outcome of the initial test result.",0.0
False,,Nick Louizos with the California Association of Health Plans. Latest version of the bill is an improvement over the first one. We also have a support if amended position and want to continue working with the author to further refine the bill and protect health plan enrollees. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Chair members, Autumn Ogden with American Cancer Society and Cancer Action Network, also in support of this bill.",0.0
False,,Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and Members. Tim Shestak with the American Chemistry Council. Appreciate the opportunity to make a few comments in opposition.,0.0
False,,"We have, as we did on last year's bill, we have two fundamental policy concerns with the bill. That the proposed label, the actual language on the label, we believe makes unsubstantiated and unscientific conclusions about the health effects of all flame retardant chemicals.",0.0
False,,"There's no analysis being done of each chemical to determine how it's used, at what levels. Whether there's any sort of exposure and whether those exposures may end up being problematic to a consumer.",0.0
False,,"And secondly, we believe that the bill circumvents the states two existing chemical and product regulation laws that are already on the books. Prop 65 and the Safer Consumer Products Regulation currently being implemented by the Department of Toxic Substance Control.",0.0
False,,"First on Prop 65. The bill currently requires the label to include a general statement and I quote, ""The state has identified many 'flame retardants as being known to or strongly suspected 'of adversely impacting human health or the environment.""",0.0
False,,"As you may know, the Office of Environmental Health Hazards Assessments implement Prop 65 by establishing a list of chemicals that are known to cause cancer or reproductive harm. Chemicals are also listed on the basis of developmental toxicity.",0.0
False,,Specific product labels are only required if a product contains a listed chemical or consumer exposure would exceed a safe harbor level.,0.0
False,,"Yet, under Mr. Leno's bill that entire process is circumvented and require manufacturers to label their products regardless of what flame retardants might be used or whether the available scientific information would justify such an action.",0.0
False,,"In fact, it's our conclusion that under this bill a flame retardant chemical that may not even meet the criteria under Prop 65, or may not even be selected by DTSC as a priority chemical would be called out for special labeling requirements under this bill.",0.0
False,,"Second point on the Safer Consumer Products regulation. As many, well, I shouldn't say as many of you might know, that bill was passed in 2008, so some folks may not have been here at that time, but the legislature did pass a law authorizing DTSC to establish a process to identify, prioritize, and if necessary, evaluate chemicals of concern that might be used in consumer products.",0.0
False,,"At the same time, also evaluating potential alternatives. The current law provides DTSC with a broad array of options in terms of regulatory responses after the scientific evaluation is done. They can do nothing. They can impose use restrictions. They can impose labeling requirements.",0.0
False,,"So they run the gambit in terms of opportunities that they may be able to impose. Just last year the department has started this process. They've identified some chemicals in products, one of which is a flame retardant used in nap mats and again, it's our point that this bill is a preemption of the implementation of that law.",0.0
False,,And we should be at least that information ought to be and that analysis ought to be concluded before you require a broad labeling requirement on products that have not yet even be evaluated by DTSC.,0.0
False,,"A final point that I'll make is that just as there are a variety of different metals, industrial gases. There are a variety of different flame retardants. They're not all the same. Their chemistries are different. And I think it is important to point out that in our letter, U.S. EPA, and I'm happy to pass this out to the committee, concluded just in 2013,  and I'll quote,",0.0
False,,"""During it's review of data on flame 'retardant chemicals and (mumbles), EPA has also 'identified approximately 50 flame retardant chemicals 'that are unlikely to impose a risk to human health.""",0.0
False,,"Even under this bill, you would still be required to check a box yes or no as to whether or not your product contains those flame retardants and chemicals. If the proponents do believe that there are products that should be labeled, we believe there's a regulatory avenues in place for them to pursue that. And for those reasons, we urge the committee to hold this bill, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, Madam Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We respectfully oppose SB 671.",0.0
False,,"Members, from the paraperspective, the emergence of biosimilars or interchangeable biosimilars into the market is a welcome phenomenon. If unfettered, these products could offer substantial cost savings to the health system. Indeed, it is estimated that biosimilar competition for the 11-most popular biologics would save the US $250 billion on healthcare over a decade.",0.0
False,,"So for that reason, we are not inherently opposed to the idea of state law allowing a pathway for these drugs to enter the market, but it has to be an unhindered pathway. That is why we are opposed to bills like SB 671.",0.0
False,,"While well-intentioned, we believe it inappropriately regulates a biosimilar drug market in a way that creates barriers to access and increase cost for consumers. It does this by requiring the pharmacist to communicate to the prescriber about the dispensing of a specific product provided to the patient for no real clinical reason.",0.0
False,,"States do not need to enact these barriers, and we aren't the only ones saying this. The FDA has said that the standards it develops for determining whether a branded biologic is interchangeable with an approved biosimilar, and therefore safer substitution, will be a rigorous process. The FDA has stated that, ""If a biosimilar is designated as interchangeable with a biologic it can expect it to produce the same clinical result as a reference product."" And the FDA Commissioner has stated herself best, as stating that, ""Attempts to undermine the trust in the products are worrisome, and represent a disservice to patients who could benefit from these lower cost treatments.""",0.0
False,,"And there is a basis in law for this position. The Federal Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act statute defines the term interchangeable. ""The term interchangeable or interchangeability in reference to a biological product,"" excuse me, ""that is shown to meet the standards described elsewhere in the law, means that the biological product may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the reference product.""",0.0
False,,"Yet, in a national play, state government is asked to second guess the federal government's authority and expertise on the matter by instituting notice requirements that will make it harder to dispense these products by requiring additional work for the pharmacist, and in essence, placing a scarlet letter, if you will, on the biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar drugs, making them stand out for no apparent reason.",0.0
False,,"We have a drug cost and pricing problem in the US, and it is being felt, not just in the commercial market, but by state government as well. As best illustrated by the Administrations of Reserve of $300 million for the Hepatitis C drugs that incidentally are not even biologics, but in essence we do need help in lowering costs, the costs of drugs, and should not be enacting barriers to access, if a drug has been deemed safe, efficacious, and interchangeable by the FDA, and for these reasons we are opposed to SB 671. Thank you.",0.0
False,,I'll be brief. Good morning madam chair and members. I'm Victoria Rome with the Natural Resource Defense Council. We strongly support SB 555 to promote more sufficient delivery of water to our homes and buildings. Urban water systems deliver treated water under pressure to their customers through miles of pipes.,0.0
False,,"These pressurized systems include large numbers of valves, joints, and connections. With resulting unavoidable water loses. As Senator Wolk stated, reports have found significant water being lost through these systems. Which also means that we have a huge opportunity to save more water by improving water loss management.",0.0
False,,SB 555 would require annual reporting on water loss findings beginning in 2017. Thus providing the information on water leaks and losses on a more frequent and useful basis. The bill also requires that the water audit reports be validated by technical experts who can ensure the reliability of the data. As we grapple with another year of drought it is more urgent than ever that we improve water efficiency throughout the state.,0.0

False,,I'm open to all those ideas. I'm open to looking at font size. I'm open to looking at grace period for it to be implemented.,0.0
False,,"I'm open, definitely open, to limiting the number of ingredients on a label so that we can reach that threshold that we understand, that we get to with the consumer, that it will be very helpful to the consumer.",0.0

False,,"So I don't know how helpful it is for somebody that you're trying to protect to have a long laundry list of things that they don't know, first of all, what those things mean for the most part.",0.0
False,,I mean not many of us sitting up here do know what every single label means or ingredient and which ones are dangerous and which ones aren't. And who's got the time then to go look all those things up to see if it's dangerous or not?,0.0
False,,"So it seems to me it'd be a better use of time to have things that are actually dangerous listed for people, and then they can make those decisions.",0.0
False,,And right now what we're asking is to list more dangerous things on. The previous proposition only went to a certain threshold.,0.0
False,,So we're trying to make sure it does become a little more comprehensive to include everything possible.,0.0

False,,"Some examples of some admission criteria preferences, admissions requirement that we are seeking to eliminate in the charter school environment include as was mentioned by the senator requiring volunteer hours. I was recently actually this year public advocates put out a piece of research regarding their-- They looked at 500 schools and they found essentially that 30% of those schools and my math is slow, that's probably like 165 schools or so had volunteer hour requirements. Now, that may work if you had two parents and you know, one was working and the other was home and was available to volunteer at the school. Some of these had up to 80, 90 hour requirements a year. So, for a, you know, grandmother who is working two jobs and they may-- that family probably won't even apply to the school when they see the set of requirements. It's a deterrent when they actually see the application.",0.0
False,,"One quick example at Santiago charter school authorized by Orange Unified School District, they require 12 service hours and that parents fill out a form indicating whether they would like to volunteer for those hours or donate money, for every $10 donated, you will receive one service hour credit. That's an example of a kind of discriminatory admission requirements we're talking about.",0.0
False,,"The second one, academic the senator mentioned that also in some cases particularly in San Bernardino, a charter school named Public Safety Academy made headlines this year about having a minimum GPA of 2.0 to get into the school. Now, in some cases, you do have magnate schools as part of a larger school that have a GPA or we've seen gate programs as part of the school. That's different from having a GPA requirement at, you know, the entire school where the charter school is physically is not letting people in who are not achieving well particularly with respect to the fact that in '92 when charter schools were established in the state of California, one of the explicit purposes and I'm reading from ed. code about why charter schools were created was to increase learning opportunities for all pupils with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for pupils who identified as academically low-achieving. So if you're meant to serve low-achieving students, it doesn't make sense to have a 2.0 GPA bar.",0.0
False,,"Increasingly, we have seen these admission requirements and preferences getting more and more creative. One of the most creative ones I saw was here locally at Natomas Charter School that has in their lottery policy, yes it has a performing arts mission and yes they have auditions, I would suggest that as a tax payer and my son takes piano lessons, even if he was really horrible at piano, you know, my tax dollar fund that school, he should be able to attend that school regardless of what his ability is at piano.",0.0
False,,"But specifically in their preferences, they include a preference score, elected adviser to the board and I would submit what is an elected adviser to the board. To me what that means is a school board sits together and maybe they elect somebody who's kid gets a special preference to come into that school. Those kinds of creative preferences, it should not be allowed, they're discriminatory. And so what we're looking at here is-- and these are the result truly of like an hour of Google research on the internet. So, if those are the once that are public, you can imagine how many other types of admission criteria and preferences haven't been put out to the public and are also, you know, limiting student access at charter schools. Charter schools are public schools. They must be available to all students. We urge your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Thank you madam chair. Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association, I want to start with a couple of comments. One, we really appreciate the fact that the author has spent some time with us this week especially and we really appreciate your work on this and your staff's work.

We're taking one last look at it but we feel optimistic.",0.0
False,,"I do feel obligated to say though in response to the supporters that charter schools do not adopt the mission requirements and preferences unilaterally without oversight. They are part of the petition process. They must go to the school district and the school district must approve them. So if there are preferences and if there are admission requirements, it must be done with the approval of the school district, a very important distinction that was not apparent in the supporter side of the presentation.",0.0
False,,"The second piece of the bill has to do with the disciplinary policies. The proposal as it is right now would impose an additional 53 education code requirements on charter schools. When some re-regulation of charter schools is proposed, the first question out of our mouth is always is, what's the justification? Demonstrate to us that there was a problem.",0.0
False,,"So far, we have not been able to get the information that justifies the problem. We have taken effect. We have witnesses here to talk about this. We have taken the data from CDE on suspensions especially expulsion data unfortunately is not as good as suspension data. We have used the same methodology that UCLA has done in their unreleased report. We've not even seen it, so people are quoting it. We're not sure how they're quoting it. And have found that our experience with suspensions is actually better than traditional public schools. We suspend less students than traditional public schools.",0.0
False,,"The references to national studies, keep in mind that we're a 50-state country and post national studies are looking at all of the 50 states. They are not looking at California specifically or exclusively. And so things that are happening in the District of Columbia for example which was referenced in the author's offices, notes on the bill or fact sheet on the bill, you know, District of Columbia is not the state of California and what happens in DC does not happen in California.",0.0
False,,"We feel very proud of what we do relative to disciplinary policies and I should point out once again disciplinary policies are approved by the school district. They are not approved unilaterally by the charter school. And they are outlined in great deal. If anybody has ever seen a charter petition, it is not this thick, it is this thick. So all those things that are in two pages in the statute are actually in four or five two-inch binders and they include expansive information on disciplinary policies. So we can-- if people demonstrate to us that there's really a problem, then let's talk about it. But that has not been demonstrated, we've-- as repeatedly for data that justifies the need for this portion of the bill and have not received it.",0.0
False,,"The last two items in the bill, I'll hit very quickly, there are changes to the notification process where a student leaves a charter school. Again, we're not sure why that's necessary, dropping the time frame from 30 days to 10 days is a challenge for charter schools. Anybody in education knows that there are times when students leave school and don't come back as fast as you would think they would. Not quite sure where they've gone, family emergencies, family vacations, where the schXTool is not notified. In 10 days, we don't necessarily know why the student left or whether the student is coming back.",0.0
False,,"We're also concerned about handing documentation-- confidential documentation to the school district if we don't know for sure that the student who does leave us is going to go to that school district. We're handing them student level, instructional data. We're providing them HIPAA data that is protected under state and federal law and handing it to a school district when they don't know the school, the district is going to take that student is a liability against us and a liability against the school district.",0.0
False,,"The last piece on teacher turnover, we actually think there might be something useful. We don't think it should be district level. We think the policy should be set at the state Department of Education and then have the districts implement. Otherwise, you're going to have a thousand different data collections that may not match. You're not going to have any comparability for that data. We think if it flows from the state down to the district, you might actually get something that could be useful to everybody. For those reasons at this point, we are opposed to the bill. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"My name is Daniel McLaughlin. I'm the founder and CEO of the One Purpose School. We will serve a population of 97% free and reduced lunch actually in your district, Senator Leno.

False,,"And with respect to restorative justice, we did have a long conversation in the last legislative session around willful defiance, around the idea that we need to figure out ways not to send kids home, that we need to figure out ways to provide supports for kids, and to be blunt, none of that conversation had any impact on the charter school environment because at charter schools, the education code that we're talking about there with respect to suspension and expulsion is waived.",0.0
False,,"So in other words, they weren't required necessarily to follow some of those provisions that we were establishing that truly represent a good practice at all California public schools. So there is explicit ed code that says in terms of alternative to suspension and expulsion, that rather than send a child home, a principal could implement several alternatives to suspension and expulsion. One of those explicitly in code being restorative justice.",0.0
False,,"So in putting forth a requirement that charter schools comply with the suspension and expulsion provisions of the education code, it also then delineates what are some reasons that a child could be suspended from school, what alternatives are kind of best practices recommended through statute that a principal could use rather than send a child home.",0.0
False,,"So in essence, I would say just the opposite. It would encourage the use of alternatives and explicitly restorative justice enforcing charter schools to comply with the suspension expulsion provisions of the education code. Some of the data that the opposition was referencing with respect to suspension and expulsion what the data shows is very incomplete because there's not a requirement to use the suspension and expulsion provision. So then to rely on what that data says when a district is not obligated to report that data-- I'm sorry, a charter school is not obligated to report that data in the first place is extremely problematic.",0.0
False,,"Just kidding. I would say there's two sides to that conversation. On the one hand, I know that recently, both the Charter Schools Association and-- not recently, I would say two years ago maybe. There was a conversation around what kinds of protections a charter school should have if they were being sued by the public. Would it be similar to a traditional public school if there was a safety issue? And the conversation was just locally actually around Sacramento High School, charter high school where for example a child is not automatically suspended or expelled for example for sexual assault or for bringing a weapon to school and does that create a different standard of safety?",0.0
False,,"So in the one hand, I think that's part of the conversation, but I also hear what you're saying about do some of these zero tolerance policies impact flexibility? Certainly, the conversation around Senate Bill 420 was just the opposite. It was a conversation that was focused on how do we essentially stop sending kids home, which is not helping kids and instead help those kids.",0.0
False,,"So in-- again in requiring compliance with the suspension expulsion provisions of the education code, you bring that conversation to bear on the charter school community as well and encourage those alternatives. That's truly where the-- That's the direction we're heading in the legislature and we think it should apply to all public schools whether traditional or whether charter.",0.0

False,,Evaluation is already based on multiple factors and teachers are already a part of the process of determining evaluation procedures as of course they should be. But introducing the design or the selection rather of evaluation standards into the negotiation and collective bargaining environment is a fundamental change.,0.0
False,,"Simply, think about in these terms. We are going from developing evaluation standards to negotiating them. That is a tremendous change. This creates the opportunities as my colleague said for stakeholders to leverage important evaluation standards related to student achievement or gains related to salary or negation.",0.0
False,,The expansion and the scope of collective bargaining will greatly increase the frequency of impasse and concerted action as such strikes.,0.0

False,,"We have been having conversations with the administrators, with school boards, with the Charter Schools Association, with Classified School Staff to bring forward the best policy. And I know that this committee last week considered bill by Senator Pavley which was about a very small authorizer that placed the charter school outside of its school district and what I want to clarify is that that was an isolated incident.",0.0
False,,That there are several tiny districts throughout the state where they're authorizing charter schools when they don't have either the capacity to do that kind of oversight and so I know that my colleague from California Virtual Academy is going to talk about some of their structure and some similar things that we've seen in different areas with authorizers across the state.,0.0
False,,"But the questions we were proposing as stake holders is number one like what are-- let's better define what exactly are your responsibilities and obligations with respect to oversight and number two, what do you need to have in place to carry out those duties.",0.0
False,,"And so what this bill suggests is that when you're considering what kind of support you have from parents, from teachers to establish a new charter school based on the petition that you also consider a report about your capacity which hopefully will be useful in determining what staff you have in place to do that important oversight work.",0.0
False,,"Do you need to build new structures? Do you need to have new staff etcetera. We were pleased to see that in the opposition letter from the Charter Schools Association, that appear they agreed on that point. That it would be useful for a school district to assess how it will conduct oversight.",0.0
False,,"Additionally, this bill suggests that when a new charter petition comes forward, we also consider what the impact is going to be on other school districts-- sorry, other schools where the district has oversight capacity. In most cases charter schools are authorized by a school district although we recognize some could be authorized by county office, some by state board.",0.0
False,,"The idea is that the authorizer takes a look at their charter schools, takes a look at their traditional public efforts to provide better coordination. And develops a plan for all the schools that they're responsible for oversight looking at things like the geographic distribution of schools,",0.0
False,,"projected demographic changes and that new charter petitions that come forward are evaluated in respect to how they impact that plan. What we have seen from voters is-- before any charter schools approved, voters would love us to conduct an analysis of the impact that the school will have on neighborhood public schools. The public doesn't want their great neighborhood public school harmed by decisions that are made by their elected officials.",0.0
False,,"In the polling data we see basically it's that school down the street two blocks down where I send my kids has a great for foreign arts program, has a wonderful library, has a science lab, whatever you're doing as a district don't impact this great neighborhood school. So what is this bill about? This bill is about what all Californians want which is a great school in every neighborhood. We urge your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Madam Chair and members, Nancy Chaires Espinoza with the California School Boards Association. As you know current law does not allow a local education agency to deny a charter petition even if the school board or county office knows that doing so would result in negative certification or if they know, they simply don't have that capacity to provide the necessary oversight.",0.0
False,,This bill would provide that ability which we think is very important and in some areas where there are-- where there's declining enrollment or w have small rural school districts for example this is a particularly important issue so we respectfully ask for your support for this measure. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Thank you, Madam Chair and members. Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association. We really appreciate the work of the committee and certainly the author in agreeing to take out the negative fiscal impact portion of the bill that was the biggest part of the bill that we objected to but we are still very concerned about the bidding practices piece.",0.0
False,,"I do want to point out that as Mr. Bramble indicated, we did think-- do think the idea of the school district doing some analysis on their capacity to do oversight is really helpful and we think that they should be doing that not as a reason to reject the charter but so they can prepare themselves to do the right thing when the charter is authorized.",0.0
False,,"And hey, they make sure that they put the right resources into it. I do want to comment on one of the comments that the-- one of the CAVA representatives made about the oversight of this-- of the charter schools from tiny school districts. For those who may not be aware charter schools have to pay anywhere from 1 to 3% of their revenue to the oversight district.",0.0
False,,So a very tiny school district that's authorizing a school that has 3000 students in San Diego is bringing in $300 000 from the charter school. I think that's enough money to pay for sufficient resources to be doing aggressive oversight. I think Madam Chair in your comments on SB 322 earlier today really hit the nail on the head relative to that bill and this bill.,0.0
False,,"The problem is really about oversight and as you've instructed us and I'm taking it back to CCSA, let's see if we can come up with some ideas to strengthen oversight but clearly, resources is not a problem. We're paying a lot of money to school districts to make sure that we're doing out job.",0.0

False,,Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We're in opposition to the measure. We just saw the amendments about 45 before the committee hearing today and were not involved in any of the discussions or in any of the negotiations.,0.0
False,,So it's impossible for us to fully analyze the impact of these amendments on the bill. We do know from a cursory glance of the language that we are still in opposition to the bill.,0.0
False,,"The prior approval piece coming out we do believe is important on the heels of the debate over Prop 45, however, there are still several issues with the bill that we have and are likely to have moving forward.",0.0
False,,"First and foremost members, the bill is very cumbersome and in certain respects suffers from a bit of an identity crisis in that the first section of the bill requires health plans to report aggregate large employer data to the Department of Managed Healthcare and the Department of Insurance.",0.0
False,,And part two of the bill requires health plans to then further report individual large employer data to those regulators as well for the purposes of regulatory action and based on triggers. What we fear would be a consequence of putting these provisions into law is really the loss of innovation and large group market.,0.0
False,,"Based on a survey that we conducted a number of years ago, we found through our members that there are about 14 to 15,000 large group policies in the state of California. The large employer market is highly customized. It's not standardized like the individual or small group market.",0.0
False,,"That's because employers sometimes want more, and they're willing to pay for more. For instance, some employers will initiate a wellness program or things of that nature as part of their benefits to their employees. And of course the health plan is there to help them to design those benefits.",0.0
False,,"If we lose customization in that market as a way to avoid regulatory action or review of the rates, large employers are also in a better position to self-insure their products, which means that if they do that, that escapes essentially any type of oversight by the state or requirements of state legislation for the most part.",0.0
False,,So that is just a public policy consideration for legislators to consider if we keep adding to the administrative load of the large employer market. We will also say that through the Affordable Care Act health plans in all markets have to comply with a medical loss ratio.,0.0
False,,"So what this means is that 80 to 85% of the premium dollar by law, federal and state, has to go to medical services. The remaining 20 to 15 is reserved for necessary administrative expenses in rate of return.",0.0
False,,"So if premiums remain flat or if they go down or if they go up, you know, in our view that is a true reflection of the cost of care for those products.",0.0
False,,"Furthermore, as noted by the supporters, we negotiate at the end of last session and removed our opposition to Senator Leno's SB1182, which allows large purchasers, including labor trusts, to request from the health plan claims data that they can use to review the costs.",0.0
False,,So we don't understand why in the first year of implementing that bill we need to be back here debating that information being sent to the state.,0.0
False,,"We're in the first year of implementing that bill in Senator Mitchell's committee Senate sub three, the DMHC requested, and I believe those positions were granted, positions that would help oversee the implementation of that bill.",0.0
False,,"If the sponsors of that bill are running into problems with our member health plans, they can come to us and talk about that. But that bill was a negotiated agreement at the end of session between us and the sponsors of the bill.",0.0
False,,We're facing several cost drivers in the healthcare system. Drugs are on the rise. Provider consolidation is a problem. We face several challenges. Health plans do what they can to negotiate the best rates that they can on behalf of the purchaser.,0.0
False,,So we're highly opposed to the bill and ask you to vote no. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"They would be subject to rate review and if they hit a certain threshold it would be, they could be deemed at unreasonable by the regulator. It's my understanding. I mean, again, the bill is just being amended today so there would be a regulatory action associated with that filing. It's not merely pure transparency.",0.0
False,,"So, you know, we don't have a cost estimate for this particular bill but a rate review bills for a large group in the past have triggered Department of Finance opposition due to the state cost associated.",0.0
False,,"I don't have a dollar figure associated with particular bill yet, but because this triggers individual filings we would expect at least the cost to be high.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, yes we do expect this to be expensive for the companies, again, we are just reviewing the amendments but I would require that hiring of new staff, actuaries and other types of staff in order to prepare what we think will be volumes and volumes of individual filings.",0.0
False,,"Again, at, for my testimony the large employer market is highly customized. There are thousands of different policies.",0.0
False,,"Some employers actually have different policies agreed to even with the same health plan, so a health plan may have a contract with a large employer for various products within their company, so it's highly complicated in customized business.",0.0
False,,"It's a fair question. Senator, again, we're going to have to review the amendments. If the factors, we believe the factors are, conflict with which might be currently cataloged by the health plan.",0.0
False,,Good afternoon Mr. Chair and members. Connie Delgado with the California Hospital Association. Here in opposition for two main reasons.,0.0

False,,"Well, there are existing penalties that CDPH has that are for the, under the EMTALA regulations, under those guidelines.",0.0
False,,"This bill would create a separate scheme with additional penalties for that that are higher than the current, so essentially it's the current law plus and additional higher penalty.",0.0
False,,And. I'm sorry without evidence that there's an issue that needs to be addressed in our opinion.,0.0

False,,"AB 708 will require manufacturers of cleaning products to list the ingredients on their product label, and on its website.",0.0
False,,"I recognize and appreciate the feedback from the committee members, and I have made the following improvements to the bill.",0.0
False,,"One, to avoid diluting the label too much with too much information, manufacturers much list the most prevalent ingredient within a product up to a maximum of 20 ingredients.",0.0
False,,"In addition, the product label must include any ingredients that have been identified by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control as a hazardous material.",0.0
False,,"If a product contains more than 20 ingredients, the manufacturer must disclose the number of ingredients not listed on the label and direct consumers to the product's website for the comprehensive list of ingredients.",0.0

Because one of the things we've gotta look for, hopefully, is that the monies that we generate like we were saying about local control and making sure we take care of the people there, we probably need to also start looking from a budgetary standpoint, how we can drive funds back to the state agencies so we can, fund whatever we need.",0.0
False,,"Especially if we need some type of oversight group, or individual to take care of that. And from a budgetary standpoint, I can see where we could implement something in that. Where it would hopefully be a budget neutral in the long run.",0.0
False,,"And might I add, if there's something more, for example, the word 'exclusive', being stricken, and the word 'primary' is being used, if there's another nomenclature that they want, we're willing to work with them to provide them security that we're not trying to preempt local control.",0.0

We certainly appreciate and share the author's concern about opioid drug abuse which of course results in far too many overdoses and deaths. This is why health plans in part utilize medical management controls that prevent the expenditure of premium dollars on abusive behavior. So it is a serious problem for America, but however, we do not believe that this bill will significantly curb the abuse of these drugs as eloquently laid out by Mr. Caldwell.",0.0
False,,"Our association typically opposes new health benefit mandates because they drive up health care costs for enrollees in the individual and employer markets. New mandates may conflict with the federal Affordable Care Act rules regarding essential health benefits. According to those rules, states have to pay 100% of the health exchange subsidies to consumers for the cost associated with new mandates that extend beyond the essential health benefits. Mandates reduce the flexibility in benefit design for large employers. They also increase premiums.",0.0
False,,"On this last point we do believe that this bill will increase costs for the purchasers of health care. The, this committee as well as Health Committee could have benefited from the independent analysis by on the premium impacts of this bill. As is the usual process for mandate bills. As, as noted by Mr. Caldwell, this bill has been introduced in a number of other states and in those states, the fiscal notes indicate premium increases as a result of that legislation.",0.0

False,,"California has a distinct and separate process for laying off teachers and for dismissing teachers, and those two processes are totally separate and must remain separate. They serve totally different purposes and they're both very valuable.",0.0

False,,"The idea of tying ev... Uh, layoffs to an evaluation system is really problematic and erodes those seniority rights.",0.0
False,,We strongly oppose.,0.0

Sorry, when there's a class that's needed a very particular set of training for that course of study, including the training, Including the experience, including the appropriate credentialing.",0.0
False,,"So, what's very common, you know, a couple years ago when there were huge amounts of layoffs, was to skip over special ed teachers, was to skip over math teachers, hard-to-staff subjects like science. That was a regular practice to deviate from seniority to make sure that you had someone in that position.",0.0
False,,But the intent is to preserve your experience in a quick slice but preserve those areas where you absolutely need someone to fill that assignment.,0.0
False,,"Well, I know that there was some conversation earlier about collective bargaining,with respect to the layoff process. And that is a subject that is open to the collective bargaining process if there's a desire to do something unique with in terms of the layoff process.",0.0
False,,"What also is, occurs is that a district will often create its own skipping criteria that's approved in a board meeting, where they'll make a decision about how, for example, they might deal with a tie if there's two people who have the exact same hire date, how that will be dealt with.",0.0

False,,"This bill does two things, really it extends to a 3 year probationary period, in addition, though, has, hasn't been discussed too much.",0.0
False,,"It also gives a district the ability to remove someone's permanent status if they got a series of negative evaluations. Understand, if a district is not happy with the performance of an educator, they should remove their employment, not remove their due process.",0.0
False,,"What this suggests is that you would be removing someone's due process rather than simply removing that person. If someone's getting a series of negative evaluations, you've determined you don't want them anymore. You move through the dismissal process.",0.0
False,,"We've spent a lot of effort in a bipartisan effort last year really prioritizing, streamlining, ensuring that that process Is less costly, is more efficient, and still preserves due process.",0.0
False,,"But it doesn't make sense to have a situation where someone has been teaching, let's say 30 years and now, because they've gotten so expensive in terms of the system, that we now remove their due process.",0.0
False,,"And just release that person, with no ability to challenge what occurred. So it does open a door to those kinds of conversations around age discrimination. The current length of probationary period encourages good personnel practices and supervision by the principal.",0.0
False,,"We heard the support witness talk about an 18 month period. To break that down, if a evaluator comes in, a brand new teacher sees, you know, something that they don't like, in the beginning of the year, in the evaluation process.",0.0
False,,"And identifies some professional development, some areas that that educator needs to improve and then comes back later in the year and that educator hasn't met that bar, let's say 6 months later they haven't, reached the level of growth that the evaluator expects.",0.0
False,,"They still can essentially say at that point, hey here was the bar. You didn't make the bar. You've got 6 months to show me something or you know, you're gonna have to be non-reelected. It's a hard thing, you know, to do certainly.",0.0
False,,"I was non-reelected my first year actually of teaching in San Jose when I taught In high-needs community of color there. But what I would say is, I've talked with a number of administrators who have no interest in going to a 3 year evaluation period.",0.0
False,,"What, wha, sorry, a 3 year probationary period. The primary reasons for that is, principals always wanna give an educator every opportunity to improve. And as a result, would likely be holding folks who they know probably should be picking another profession for a third year to continue working with kids.",0.0
False,,"They would rather make that decision after 2 years. They felt that time was sufficient to make that decision. Taken as a whole, the proposals within Assembly Bill 1248 would move California in the opposite direction of what sensible reform entails.",0.0

False,,"Mr. Chair, Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association.",0.0
False,,"We're concerned that charter schools don't have to follow most of the education code.

That said, we really appreciate the amendments that were taken and I am hopeful after looking at the language that we'll be able to remove our opposition.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Thurmond, I appreciate, appreciate the question. It, the funding determination process is confusing even to those of us who deal with it a lot.",0.0
False,,"And what it's intended to do is to deal with those that are non-classroom based, that have no bricks and mortar. The schools that are bricks and mortar, that want to do blended learning, want to do blended learning in a range of ways that could dip below that 20% mark.",0.0
False,,"We've put a new floor in at 60% because we believe there needs to be a floor, but we didn't want to penalize them if they went to 79 or 78%. Because if they did, they would lose a lot of money.",0.0
False,,"And so giving them the flexibility, giving the State Board of Education some control and some accountability, as I know the Chair was very concerned about, ensures that the money is being spent and the money is being spent appropriately delivering an educational model to the kids.",0.0

False,,"We know we've got one in El Segundo that's right across from Boeing. They take their kids to Boeing and actually do some of the more practical applications of what they're learning in the classroom, right there in an engineering site.",0.0

False,,"It's, it's not actually a percentage. The funding determination process as it works now, it's based on regulations and criteria the state board has developed over a number of years.",0.0
False,,"And what they do, is they look at the cost of operating a, in this, in, in current law, a non-classroom based school. And they make a funding determination, how much they're going to pay in ADA to that school based on their costs.",0.0
False,,"They would do the same thing for blended learning charter schools. So if, if there is a reduction, it would be a reduction reflected on off of their costs being less than they would be in a 100% site-based school.

False,,"Not currently because, because the 80% creates a wall. If they go below the 80% under current law, they will lose money. So they have, they have skirted the 80% as close as they come.",0.0
False,,"It's like a precipice, and they don't want to go over because the consequences are pretty awful. So they have gone down to 80% but they have been straining to do more blended learning, and so we talked to them and figured that 60% was a reasonable additional relief for them.",0.0

False,,And so I would not have gotten to that if some -- If we hadn't had hearings. I got that in a hearing. I didn't get that through my own analysis. I didn't get that from staff. I didn't get that from the committee staff. That came out of a hearing and now we're aggressively looking at it.,0.0
False,,And at the worst case scenario I hope we get $0.10 on the dollar and we're able to find maybe $1.6 billion that can go back as a revenue stream -- That can go back in to the courts. That can hopefully eliminate that deficit of the money we took from the courts over the last ten years.,0.0

You're at $500,000 plus per person. And I think I just heard another 126 million or 126 million total. In more state funds needed to back filled due to decertification, plus whatever else is on this budget agenda that you have that, that was excellent by the way.",0.0
False,,"Meanwhile the contrast there that you have to keep in mind, is that we've only had one increase in community based programs in 15 state budgets, one. 2006-7. We took that away two years later, and just in the last two years restored that back to 2006-7 levels. Instead, what this legislature has done repeatedly is chosen to poor more and more money into these institutions.",0.0

False,,"It's not necessarily that there's not a lot of cullet, I'm sorry, cullet is recycled glass. I should probably back up and stop using terms, it's a weird term anyway, there's just not enough of it, quality material in California to meet the demands of what they want, as all the proponents said, there's enough incentive for glass manufacturers to use recycled glass, there's already the incentive is there, you don't need a lot to tell them to do it.",0.0

False,,"I want to clarify something. Californians Against Waste is right up to a point, he's underselling it. For glass, it'll be a 100% elimination of the processing fee offset. The beverage manufacturers are the ones getting the offsets, so that our customer gets it, and if the plants that are supplying beer bottles, cause that's what we're talking about is beer bottles, cause that's what's in the program.",0.0
False,,"If they don't meet the minimum content standard, the beverage manufacturer doesn't get the processing fee offset, which is somehow passed onto us, but it just won't be met. There's not enough material in the marketplace to meet the standard. Just not enough. The Glass Packaging Institute is in other states lobbying for bottle bills.",0.0
False,,"We want bottle bills, we want beverage recycling programs to work, and we lobby for 'em, and we're part of initiatives to pass 'em. We're a unique state, and the cullet supply is not there to meet the standard, and this bill essentially serves as a backdoor way to take our processing fee offset away, making our product uncompetitive.",0.0
False,,"If I can, just for what it's worth, the out-of-state manufacturers and the in-state manufacturers, they're all the same manufacturers.

False,,"Mr. Chairman. Tim Shestak with the American Chemistry Council. You heard our arguments on this bill in a previous hearing, but I would just want to touch on a couple points.",0.0
False,,"We have two fundamental policy concerns with the bill as drafted and this is the notion of taking general class of chemicals and without assessing whether those chemicals or how they're used in what amounts, analyzing whether there's any potential for exposure, and then drawing a conclusion that these chemistries, regardless of any of the facts that may result from any sort of an analysis require a special label for these consumer products.",0.0
False,,"And I think the second point I'd make is that we believe this bill circumvents existing regulatory programs that are in place that are designed to address these very questions and oppose, if warranted, similar regulatory requirements.",0.0
False,,"So, as the bill is drafted, it currently requires a new label to include a general statement that the state has identified many flame retardants as being known to or strongly suspected of adversely affecting human health or development.",0.0
False,,"As you guys know, Prop 65 requires the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to establish a list of chemicals that are known to cause cancer or reproductive harm. Specific labels are only required if the product contains illicit chemical where consumer exposure would exceed a safe harbor level.",0.0
False,,"Under Senator Leno's bill, manufacturers would be required to label their products regardless of what flame retardants they would contain or whether the available evidence would justify such an action.",0.0
False,,"I think in my view it's akin to just essentially having a label that says this product contains or does not contain chemicals. The label, such a label would be meaningless, because there's really no assessment or, I guess, recognition of chemicals or how they're used.",0.0
False,,"Each has a different health and environmental profile. How they're used in products is not the same. Exposure levels are not the same and certainly potential health and environmental impacts are not the same. So, without answering these questions, the bill concludes that certain products should carry a special label, generalizing that this product could be harmful to consumers.",0.0
False,,"So, I think that's certainly a major fundamental concern that we have with this precedent of lumping all of these flame retardant chemicals under one heading, but interestingly enough, the state does have a program in place to answer these very questions.",0.0
False,,"To assess chemicals and products and answer whether or not regulatory requirements are in place and, as you know, that program is currently being operated by the Department of Toxics.",0.0
False,,"That program offers, authorizes DTSC broad regulatory authority from banning chemicals outright to imposing labeling requirements if, once they go through that assessment process determine that perhaps a labeling requirement is warranted.",0.0
False,,"Just last year, one of the first products what was identified was a flame retardant chemical used in certain juvenile products.",0.0
False,,"So, the second policy, principle that I think this bill violates in our view is that regardless of that assessment and regardless of that regulation that DTSC is currently implementing, this bill would impose a new labeling requirement on these products.",0.0
False,,"So, from our standpoint, just as there are different industrial metals, different industrial gasses, there are different categories of flame retardants that should be evaluated and those specific questions should be evaluated on how those chemicals are used and in what products and what potential exposure scenarios might take place.",0.0
False,,"So, for those reasons, we are currently opposed to the bill. I would, the other point I would add and this is really not our issue, but I know some of the manufacturers have raised this issue is that this bill would require companies who don't even use these products or are not even adding flame retardant chemicals to their product would require an additional label indicating that no, we don't use those products.",0.0
False,,"From a general standpoint, a policy standpoint, that's another issue that I'd like to raise, but for these reasons, we do respectfully oppose the bill as it's currently drafted. Thank you.",0.0

False,,"In fact, we insist on retaining control and on staying informed. Having private and secret meetings to discuss how tax dollars are being spent is not innovation and in fact, it's resulted in quite a few horror stories. I have with me Kyle Serrette, from the Center for Popular Democracy, to discuss a report put out in March of this year.",0.0
False,,"That outlines more than $81 million of fraud of waste of abuse of tax dollars by charter school operators to date. But to talk about, and that's in this state, but to talk about how frequency this is occurring, I did kind of a quick Google search about just since the release in March 2015 to now. So I'm talking about the last two months and found seven additional instances.",0.0
False,,"Happy to walk through those if you guys, desire, but what this bill is saying to charter schools is by all means do what you want but do it out in the open where everyone can see. That's why we're talking about open meetings, that's why we're talking about public records. What this bill truly is saying is dream big and think outside the box,",0.0
False,,"but don't abuse the public trust and spend that money on our kids, spend it on our students. We urge your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association. I just have to say wow. The last support statements were very surprising. I didn't realize that there was $84 million in fraud that charter schools were perpetrating on the state of California.",0.0
False,,"I sincerely regret that and will certainly check into where all that fraud is occurring. Also like to point out that, the statement that there are no regularly scheduled audits of charter schools is perplexing. I suggest you ask the superintendent of public instruction whether any schools or schools districts are audited.",0.0
False,,"And he will tell you, they all are. The controller audits them. We also have to do private audits that are shared with our school district authorizers. Our authorizers oversee our finances. To make those statements in support of this bill is really very surprising. And I really didn't want to talk about that, but those things had to be responded to.",0.0
False,,"So I do want to get into what I do want to talk about, and that's two things. One is CCSA does agree that the law needs to be clarified, and we've made it very clear over many, many years. That the law needs to be clarified. We support changes to the Public Records Act. We support changes to the Political Reform Act.",0.0
False,,"We support changes so that the Brown Act that include charter schools. The one thing that we don't agree with is government code 1090, and we've made it very clear from the beginning, for the last few years, that, that is a real problem. It's become even more apparent to us how much of a problem.",0.0
False,,"Charter schools do not have the same flexibility that school districts have in order to accommodate financial crisis. And nothing illustrates this better than what school districts and charter schools recently went through relative to the deferral of payments, that besieged us all during the recession.",0.0
False,,"School districts had a lot more options to pursue in order to get through that period. The charter schools did not. We had to turn to our board members, we haven't had to turn to our founders and our staff just to keep our doors open. Under government code 1090, which is a meekly approach to controlling conflict of interest,",0.0
False,,"many of our charter schools may not have survived, because they wouldn't have been able to turn to these people and ask for help because they were board members and they would be prohibited from helping. Or we'd have to say we'll take your money but you can no longer be on our board.",0.0
False,,"We're simply asking that a provision of the law that is so draconian when it comes to an organization, like a charter school. Needs to be excluded from this proposal. I will say, and, and many of you are new, and many of you have not heard this before. And I hope that you don't have to hear it as many times as we have had to hear it.",0.0
False,,"But the reality is this is an issue that has been down this road several times. This is an issue that the governor has made clear, in 2011 with AB 360. Last year with AB 913, that he's not interested in seeing a bill with government code 1090 in it. We have said from the beginning that if we collectively, CTA and Axon, CSBN,",0.0
False,,"and all the other organizations grab hands and walk down to the governor's office with a deal that we can all support, we believe we can finally convince the governor to make some changes in governance and conflict of interest that will serve everybody and serve everybody well.",0.0
False,,"And we would encourage this committee, at some point, if it's not today later in the process, to allow us all to do that. Put 1090 aside. Keep three quarters of the bill and move it forward to the Governor's office and get a signature. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Sure. Mr. Thurmond, thank you for the questions, and hopefully I can explain this concisely. First, please understand that 1090 is an absolute statute. There is no wiggle room, there is no recusal not even a question of whether you benefit or not. If you are on the board of directors, you cannot engage in any financial interaction with the organization on whose governing board you sit.",0.0
False,,Does not include contributions.,0.0
False,,You could make a donation.,0.0
False,,"Absolutely. So, charter schools, unlike school districts, often depend, especially during their opening phases, depend on the benefits provided by founders, by board members, people who are committed to making sure that the charter school is open and runs successfully and can keep the doors open, and that's not always a whole lot of people.",0.0
False,,"Some charter schools may do really well in the long run relative to fundraising, but early on, and also in periods of recession like we recently experienced, we often turn to people who are so passionate about the school, that they have committed themselves not only financially, but also to its governance.",0.0
False,,"And so when you have somebody who's willing to step up and, for example, provide a better than market rate on a facility that he or she owns that can be used for the charter school could even arrange a lease that's at zero, it's still a lease, and it's still a contract. And so while the charter school may be paying little or nothing for",0.0
False,,"that facility, the person offering that could not sit on the Board of Directors and offer it. Even if it's $0.",0.0
False,,"Well, certainly not with me, but we could certainly share that with you. And would certainly defer to leg counsel if leg counsel has an opinion on that provision of the law as well. I hate to put you on the spot.",0.0
False,,"Just to be clear, our experience with it is it's very absolute, and it could be zero dollars, but as long as a contract is involved, like a lease, it would apply.",0.0
False,,"Well there's the deferral issue we had members sitting on the board of directors who actually loaned money sometimes at zero or a very low rate, in order to get them through, and that was, you know, it was a real help to many charter schools.",0.0
False,,"I appreciate that, and you're absolutely right. We can't work it out in committee this afternoon. And look forward to talking. And again, most of you have not been down this path before so you haven't had the experience of talking about this, like Dr. Weber has many times in the past. So, what you're referring to in the 49% is the Corporations Code.",0.0
False,,"And because most of our charter schools are incorporated as non-profits, they are governed by the Corporations Code. The 49% is a threshold beyond which you cannot go in terms of financially interested parties. Meaning, for example, teachers sitting on a board of directors, people who are employed by the corporation.",0.0
False,,"It still does not mean that you can engage in a contractual relationship in which you have a conflict of interest. The corporations code is abundantly clear. About conflict of interest, relative and if you have a conflict of interest, this is the big difference with 1090, under the corporations code you can actually recuse yourself from the vote.",0.0
False,,"You can still have a contractual relationship but you can recuse yourself. You cannot influence the other members of the corporate governing body, but you don't have to relinquish your role as a member of that governing body.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, can I correct something?",0.0
False,,"I just wanted to speak briefly about the Charter School Association. Witness expressed that currently they fall under the Corporations Code with respect to this issue. And I would just, assert that Government Code 1090 is applicable right now at charter schools. This bill is intended to clarify that,",0.0
False,,"but that's part of why this is keyed not fiscal because it's basically current law, and we're putting it in statute to eliminate any lack of clarity. We're trying to make it more clear.",0.0

False,,Amber King with the Association of California Healthcare Districts also in opposition.,0.0
False,,Yeah the state of California doesn't recognize observation unit. We don't have the classification for that. There is where the conflict is.,0.0

False,,This is a discussion only.,0.0
False,,"Okay. Thank you. And so, now I'll make a brief comment. I'm also on Public Safety and there's been a lot of bills coming through and different permutations of how do we deal with human trafficking, and for the first time the chair, Mr. Quirk and I, along with Miguel Santiago, Assembly member, we said we need to come up with a comprehensive plan.",0.0
False,,"And I invite you to join that discussion because you have a critical part in making sure that we can stem this tide, or one of my colleagues likes to use the term, 'tsunami'. This whole human trafficking problem has been like a tsunami that's just overtaken us, and we're using traditional methodology to deal with prostitution, but this is much bigger than local prostitution.",0.0
False,,"It's an international problem. It's a national problem, and it's so insidious that it gets people involved in it. The victims of it are scarred for life and it takes more than just displacing them and moving them out of an area, we gotta do more. And so, we will have that conversation.",0.0

If there's any comment.",0.0

False,,"We're not very good at keeping track. Good morning, before you got here, Mr. Lackey had a question about the effectiveness of the art programs and are we keeping track, could there be better utilization of the two million dollars, as opposed to, and I believe the LAO has also had some concerns and so, I was just now mentioning that I have been to where Tim Robbins has done some programs.",0.0

And hopefully, the data that you collect, those of us that are on the committee that are a little more skeptical, with your data showing that is a proven program that helps reduce recidivism.

False,,"""What is the new buffer for out of state beds?"" is the question.",0.0
False,,"Okay. And just so you know the reason, I think we've gone decades where we have been building prisons, send people out of state to prisons, I think for the first time we can begin a discussion on eliminating prisons.",0.0
False,,"But most important, bringing people who are out of state as far as Oklahoma and Mississippi and Texas that are our prisoners, back to California. And to do it in a comprehensive way. That's why we're asking for long range so that this legislature and this body can plan for that.",0.0
False,,"And say with the LAO, how can we take those savings and then plow them back into more recidivism programs so that number can keep going down, keep on going down.",0.0
False,,"Obviously, there will be people who we're going to still need prisons for but do we really need as many as we have right now? And if we can kind of gauge what that number is so we can start drawing down in a responsible way because obviously, the last thing we want to do is eliminate a prison when we really need one.",0.0
False,,"Or eliminate some of the contract beds outside the state, when we may need them in the next five years or we need to keep that number constant. Or have that buffer, that's why it's so important to know what that buffer is. And so, as we move on, hopefully we continue that conversation, so we can be better at this. Are there any other questions from committee members? All right, then thank you for your update.",0.0

False,,"This community has not had but one increase over that time period in 2006, seven, and that was promptly taken away a couple years later by the legislature and Governor, because of the falling out of the economy and the state budget overall.",0.0
False,,"Restored in the last couple of years, but only restored to 2006, seven levels, so one rate increase, you basically, the legislature and the governor's offices asked community based providers to provide the same level of care to 280,000 people at a 3% increase over a 13 year period while consumer price index, alone, has risen over 30%.",0.0
False,,"It's impossible to do from a business standpoint. You don't make up negative numbers in volume by doing more, and this budget has to recognize rate increases for this community, and we urge strongly that you include that we're appreciative of Senator Stone's comments on this again.",0.0
False,,"I want to applaud him particularly coming from the Republican Wing, and looking at reinvesting and putting money, I'm glad that he's brought himself to the party quite frankly.",0.0
False,,But and the last thing.,0.0
False,,"Well your good friend Ms. Grove is on the same page too, so.",0.0
False,,"The last comment I'd make is I also dipped my pool into the volunteer side of things. I'm now, unfortunately, a board president of a local agency in Sacramento and we're at the point today where we are losing staff because of money.",0.0
False,,"That creates great instability among the people we serve and in this population, stability is everything. Please include a rate increase in this budget as you move it back along to the Governor. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Madam Chair, members. Carl London on behalf of the California Disability Services Association. We certainly support the staff recommendation in you agenda.",0.0
False,,"Would like to make one further comment and recommendation, and that is that we consider, as we're talking about developmental center closures, that we consider adding additional language that prioritize closure for those units where we have already lost the federal funding, or at significant risk for losing the federal funding.",0.0
False,,"That ought to be the highest priority for closure as we move forward with planning that, no matter what the process is, because it means more dollars out of the general fund.",0.0
False,,"And away from everything else that we would all think money should go towards in the state budget. So, we'd ask you to, consider that as well. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Yeah. Madam Chair and members, Carl London on behalf of CGSA. I want to, you know, a huge ditto to what Senator Stone had to say.",0.0
False,,"It is awfully hard to look at the January or May revision of this budget with absolutely zero in this budget, to benefit community-based programs for this population that desperately needs it.",0.0
False,,"And then also propose, in the same breath, that we give away a property, and assets that have been serving this population for decades, at zero cost. That is incredibly frustrating to look at.",0.0
False,,"The legislature can make a policy statement if it wants to, and we would urge you to do it. To look at these properties as an extension of the service system.",0.0
False,,"Grab them and at least take part of this back to the community, so we can serve this population fairly. And in accordance with the Lanterman Act.",0.0
False,,"To do otherwise is to just strip us of property and assets that have been serving the community or this population for a long, long, time. As we look at Sonoma, as we look at Fairview, Sonoma, has been in service for many decades.",0.0
False,,We can't just give this stuff away for free. It's awfully hard to feel great about the education system getting a free chunk of land out of our community. And getting nothing in return in the Governor's budget or the May revision. Thank You.,0.0
False,,"Madam Chair, members, first of all, thank you for the opportunity to speak on these items all day long today so thank you. California Disability Services Association, Carl London on behalf of them, we support this as well.",0.0
False,,"We're very excited about this, this has been on our radar for the last three years and the 20% number seems fair because we do have to worry about balancing the model of integration for our populations. So well done.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Madame Chair.  Jenny Bellow with the Legislative Analyst's Office.  On this issue, we appreciate that by using an existing infrastructure the department is able to get this funding out without reserving any of it for administrative costs at the state level.",0.0
False,,"That said, on these drought proposals we are suggesting that departments report to the legislature on the expected outcomes of this investment. How they will be measuring those outcomes and how they will be reporting those outcomes back to you, so you have some information to evaluate whether or not the investment returned the outcomes that you expected.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Madame Chair. Jenny Bellow with the legislative analyst office. On the issue of the in home supportive services case load, we've requested some backup information from the department, are continuing to look at it, and we'll advise you if we spot anything that we think is worth talking about.",0.0
False,,"On the issue of the Fair Labor Standards Act, you're faced with several elements of uncertainty here, the first being we're not sure when the federal courts will ultimately issue their decision, what that decision will be, and if there will be further appeals.",0.0
False,,"Secondly, if they do decide that states need to go forward with implementing Fair Labor Standards Act new rules on overtime, it's not clear how much lead-in time they'll give us, or how long it'll take us to get our systems up and running.",0.0
False,,"So the administration has decided to deal with that uncertainty and that risk by building in a full year of costs, to support paying for overtime for IHS providers. The legislature could decide to deal with that risk differently.",0.0
False,,"Clearly there are trade-offs, by providing a full year of funding for it in the budget year, it means you have less money freed up for other priorities, so those are the types of trade-offs and things you'll have to be thinking about.",0.0
False,,"Chairman Gomez, committee members, my name is Matt Regan. I'm here representing the Bay Area Council. We are a business sponsored, public policy, advocacy organization. Comprised of about 300 of the largest employers in the San Francisco, Silicon Valley region.",0.0
False,,"According to the latest Franchise Tax Board Data, we have about 20% of the state's population and just produced about 40% of the state's income taxes. So, we know that knowledge based economies are successful economies, we know that they help balance budgets.",0.0
False,,"But our problem in California is that we fail to produce enough high school graduates to meet the needs of that knowledge based economy. And why is that? Well, we looked back into the early years and reverse engineered the problems. It's not necessarily all on the heads of high school teachers.",0.0
False,,"We noted that a third of kids entering kindergarten in California currently lack the basic skills to compete with their peers. They lack the social, emotional skills, the self regulation and cognitive skills, to meet the levels required of them in kindergarten. The solution is to invest earlier.",0.0
False,,"Upstream, we know that a child's brain develops all of it's architecture in the first five years of life. We also know that investing in the early years produce significant returns to state coffers. According to the president's council of economic advisors, that's an average of $8 to every $1 invested.",0.0
False,,It can go as high as $16 to $1 according to the data and research done by Nobel Laureate James Hackman. That's for the kids most at risk.,0.0
False,,"Okay, so the savings come from reduced rate repetition and need for remedial education in our K-12 system. So we would urge an aye vote, it's good for our kids, it's good for our economy and it's good for our state. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Steve Cruz on behalf of San Mateo County. I understand it might be parsed off separately but we're supportive of the back affiliate of the insufficient in ERAF piece so, I appreciate that. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Brian Euler, LAO.",0.0
False,,"Just briefly, I think your agenda does a pretty good job of laying out our sort of overarching comments on this issue, so I'll just speak briefly to one of the points that you raised, and one of the outstanding issues that's mentioned in your agenda and that's the interest rates on the successor or the city agency loan agreements.",0.0
False,,"I just wanted to provide a little bit more background, Mr. Hill sort of touched on this issue that in the initial dissolution statute, these loan agreements, initially they were invalidated and a little bit of the background behind that is there was concern that many of these agreements weren't sort of arm's length transactions, and that they were structured in ways that resulted in, you could say sort of unreasonably high interest to cruel and large payments from the agency to the city.",0.0
False,,"And one of the ways that was done was with high interest rates. There were other ways that was done in terms of deferring payments or making interest only payments or just in the way that the payments were structured, and so were only talking about sort of one of those elements here in terms of the interest rate.",0.0
False,,So that's sort of the background of something to keep in mind when you're thinking about what's the correct interest rate on reinstating these loans. To the extent the legislature still has some concern that some of these loans being reinstated may have been these types of non [UNKNOWN] transactions sort of deals that provided inflated interest payment to the city then looking at the interest rate and perhaps providing something that's modestly lower then what the variable interest rate at the time back in the 80s or 90s was may be one way of addressing that concern.,0.0
False,,"That's correct, right. And I guess I should say, I don't mean to implicate every single city agency agreement, I'm sure there were many that were very valid, and were arm length transactions.",0.0
False,,But there were certainly anecdotal evidence of these types of transactions that weren't.,0.0
False,,"Good morning, I'm Susan Riggs, acting Director of the Department of Housing and Community Development. And we have been working very closely with the city to exhaust all administrative remedies. At this point, the administration has not fully vetted the proposal, and does not have a position.",0.0
False,,"Good morning, I'm Susan Riggs, acting director of HCD, again, and this is not a proposal that is coming from HCD. But I'm happy to provide some background on the programs that are being proposed, to the extent that is something that's helpful.",0.0
False,,"Okay, so the Joe Serna Jr. program is something that is not currently funded. It's a program that allows for the construction or rehabilitation of housing for farm workers, for agricultural workers. In the past it's provided housing for agricultural workers in much of our agricultural areas in California.",0.0
False,,"The OMS, the Office of Migrant Services program, again, is not currently funded. We have 24 OMS Centers throughout the agricultural areas in California. We do have some deficiencies in terms of the maintenance in our OMS centers around about $12 million,",0.0
False,,"$6 million of which has been covered by other sources so there are some outstanding maintenance issues there that are currently not funded. The Self Help Program is primarily a technical assistance program. It's capped at about $300 million in technical assistance, assistance for folks that want to self help in providing their housing.",0.0
False,,"It's not technically a rural housing program, but often times, it is used in rural areas. And then finally the $250,000 for Napa County Farm Worker Housing. Napa has been proactive in constructing three farm worker housing facilities in their community that are currently underfunded, and they're requesting some support in order to maintain the operations of those facilities.",0.0
False,,At this point we have not vetted the proposals and do not have a position.,0.0
False,,"Tim Lynch on behalf of the Napa Valley Vintners and specifically we're supporting the $250,000 augmentation for the Napa centers. These are unique around the state and a blend of funding from the county, self-assessment on the growers and rents that the farm workers themselves pay.",0.0

False,,"Hi, Danielle Blacet with the California Municipal Utilities Association. We wanted to support Proposal 823 regarding drought penalties, but I wanted to echo my colleague's comments regarding the consolidation proposal.",0.0
False,,"We think this is a super important issue that needs to be addressed, but we do think it is a public policy issue. That it belongs in a longer and more robust process than a budget Trailer Bill. Some concerns we have is the scope and application of the bill is poorly defined.",0.0
False,,"We know there are communities that are running out of water. We wanna see those issues addressed. However, the way the language is written right now, there's several terms in the bill whether it's the best means to provide water to the systems feasible, there's adequate and affordable financial assistance.",0.0
False,,"What is a failure to provide potable water? All of these terms are not defined, the way the language is written does not apply strictly to drought situations, it's to all consolidation efforts, so these are our concerns.",0.0
False,,"There's clarifications in the state drinking water plan as Ms. Ritterbush outlined, and also in the intended use plan, that the State Water Board is prepared for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund that could help clarify some of these issues.",0.0
False,,"And then also something that I wanted to mention, I know there was some discussion today among the members regarding the consolidating systems, maybe not doing the right thing. But there's actually some situations where the system that would be consolidated are refusing to do so.",0.0
False,,"So it creates some situations for a system that does wanna do the right thing. But when they go to try and consolidate with the system, they're not able to. And then also, on the liability protection concern, we also wanna make sure that's fully addressed. So those are my comments, thank you so much.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, good afternoon. Robert Gore from The Gualco Group on behalf of Imperial Irrigation District, Kings River, and Kern County. First of all, on behalf of fee payers we'd like to thank the water board for noting in 823 that it will decrease the demand on fee payers.",0.0
False,,"We appreciate that commitment. On 825 also, testimony indicated that many small districts have a negative value. I think that's worth remembering as we perhaps increase the demand on fee payers. Overall, we'd like to associate ourselves with the comments of Mr. Reed and Ms. Ritterbush and commend the administration for trying to manage this crisis.",0.0
False,,"It's immense and innumerable, as we know. Lastly, virtually all members of the committee noted that there's been much imprecision and many assumptions made. There may be a way to address this with urgency bills as opposed to a trailer bill language. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Danielle Blacet with the California Municipal Utilities Association. We have two Trailer Bills we want to comment on today. First is 823 the drought penalties bill, we support that. We definitely wanna see those penalties go towards conservation activities.",0.0
False,,"I also wanna echo the comments of my colleague Ms. Ridderbusch on the consolidation proposal. We do have some concerns, we know these communities are running out of water, we wanna be, our members wanna be a part of the solution but we do think that the language in the current proposal is overly broad.",0.0
False,,Terms are poorly defined and we wanna definitely work with you all and the administration and the water board to make sure that it's a proposal that works for drought situations now and then also to address the ongoing issue of consolidation and how our members can help.,0.0
False,,"Good afternoon. Steve Cruz on behalf of the California Building Industry Association. We had comments on the groundwater, the CEQA exemption for groundwater. We're not opposed to the CEQA exemption on permit for new wells.",0.0
False,,"That's sort of an immediate action, but there's a second part of the language in section two, that addresses an exemption for ordinances adopted related to land use decisions, including a temporary moratorium.",0.0
False,,"And so, as we see that, you'd be exempting those decisions that are made, sort of on a long-term planning basis for housing that are sometimes ten years out. That could actually have the opposite effect of, if you're in a job rich Bay Area, for instance, and there's a CEQA exemption.",0.0
False,,"And there's a move to help new development in one area. Then you're actually sort of further commute time. Just as an issue, I'm not sure that was intended, I heard Senator Pavley sort of speak about it. But we're going to be meeting with the administration next week to talk about it. But I just wanted to flag it. I'm not sure it's intended, but that's the way it's written currently. Thank you.",0.0
False,,Good afternoon. Lizette Everett on behalf of the Community College League of California representing the CEOs and trustees of all of the colleges in the system. Just to echo. Including Orange County.,0.0
False,,"Just to echo the comments previously stated, maintaining unallocated resources is very important for our colleges, again to restore some of the loss and ensure that we have adequate efforts to serve students at all levels, prepare for future retirement cost as well as growing health and energy costs. So thank you.",0.0
False,," Good afternoon, Lizette Everett on behalf of the Community College League of California. I want to align our comments with the chancellor's office with regards to adult education.",0.0
False,,"We think it's very valuable to collect data. This will be important as you move the initiative forward but do have concerns about the 49 million for data not being part of the pre-split, and also what that means for implementation pressures on.",0.0
False,,The Chancellor's office since they are not receiving staffing to do that but think it's a valuable proposal.,0.0
False,,"Also want to state that we are in support of the administration's proposal with regards to full time faculty and actually would even say that keeping that more flexible would allow for more part time parity, office hours and some of the other elements that this committee has identified as priorities.",0.0
False,,"With regards to basic skills, we are in support of the basic skills initiative, but also would consider it more important that whatever basic skills resources do go out, go to all colleges and not in a competitive or grant format. And I'm out of time. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Lizette Navarette, I'm representing the Community College League of California. Again, just want to reiterate the strong support and thank the committee for continuing your support for equity funding.",0.0
False,,This is an important issue at our colleges. We think it's important to finally address the systemic long equity gaps and opportunity gaps that exist at all colleges.,0.0
False,,"And these efforts have a lot of momentum that you will see in the years to come as it continues to implement great programs that will effect all of our students since a lot of them come from a lot of need from diverse backgrounds, and this is really important.",0.0

False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Jeff Vaca, I represent in the California Association of School Business Officials. I'm glad that Ms. Wynne said that this is complicated, because I I'm still sort of absorbing it myself.",0.0
False,,"Our organization does support the governor's May revised proposal on the mandates reimbursement issue. With respect to the staff recommendation, based on the description that's in the agenda, there's nothing in here that particularly would cause us any heartburn, I don't believe, but we have not seen the actual language.",0.0
False,,"And, I would also simply state that the concern that many of these items represent ongoing, as opposed to one-time costs. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Nicholas Chavez with the California Association of School Transportation Officials and the School Transportation Coalition. We appreciate the work in attempting to fix the school transportation joint priors agreement funding issue, but would like the consideration of an option to allow LEAs to maintain district funding with their transportation joint powers agreement.",0.0
False,,"In the interest of time, I do have the articulation of our position in the handout. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair, members, Jeff Fokker representing the California Association of School Business Officials. Associate myself with Mr. Chavez's remarks. There are very small number of JPAs that provide transportation funding in this state.",0.0
False,,"We don't believe that it would be inconsistent with the local control funding formula to allow those JPAs to receive direct funding. The school districts would actually reduce paperwork An administrative burden on those school districts, and so we would just like to have this, continue this conversation. Thank you.",0.0
False,,Mr. Chair and Committee. Michael Pimentel with the California Transit Association.,0.0
False,,Thank you. I'd like to thank...,0.0
False,,"Yeah I know. Thank you. I'd like to thank the committee and the staff for the additional attention paid to transit in this item, it's very much appreciated.",0.0
False,,I did want to make a comment however on the 25 million for transit passes. Transit passes can have an impact on transit ridership. However there is some past experiences with free passes going really to subsidize existing riders.,0.0
False,,"And so, while that may be a good thing for things like transit equity, we're not sure that it gets to the results and the exact outcome that we hoped to get from the Cap and Trade program.",0.0
False,,"We generally understood investments from cap and trade to go toward new services, new operations. And so if this appropriation is sustained, we look forward to working with the committee and the administration to make sure that this works well.",0.0
False,,I'll put a note that what we can ask for this form of additional transit assistance. We understand why groups that did ask for it support it.,0.0

False,,"Good morning Madame, Chair and members. My name is Jay Hansen, and I am a Vice President of the Sacramento School Board. and a member of the California School Board Association. Our school district serves 43,000 students in 84 schools with the help of approximately 4,000 dedicated employees. I'm here to urge your yes vote on SB 277",0.0
False,,"for two key reasons. Number one, is the most obvious, for the health and safety of our students and the school community. Just a few weeks ago, two of my schools, Judah Elementary and Einstein Middle School, had cases of whooping cough. When that happens, those schools must take several immediate and potentially costly actions.",0.0
False,,"The school district's Health Department must be immediately notified. They in turn, must contact the County Health Department to report that a vaccine-preventable disease has occurred. Our district health staff then prepares a notice specific to that illness to be sent home with every child at that school.",0.0
False,,"Every staff member at the school is notified, so we ensure a consistent message for the students and the school families. And we want to ensure the students take the note home to properly inform their parents. When it is warranted and more serious, the school principal can also make a robocall to each of the families to make sure",0.0
False,,"the message gets through. And we also work with the local media to get the information out. That's what can happen when one student has one illness. Multiply that by hundreds or thousands across the many thousands of California schools, and you can imagine the complexity, cost and disruption to the education of every other student.",0.0
False,,"Two months ago, you and the rest of the world heard about the measles outbreak here in California. It quickly spread to 10 counties, and required three different schools to quarantine many of their unvaccinated schoolchildren for three weeks until they could be safely determined to have not contracted this potentially life-threatening disease.",0.0
False,,"Once again, in addition to disrupting the education of many, many schoolchildren, and causing unnecessary anxiety to thousands of families, the cost to these school districts and the local health authorities is great. And of course, we cannot forget the children who contracted this easily preventable disease,",0.0
False,,"because they could be in for a lifetime of medical complications. The number two reason I urge a yes vote, gets to the foundation of education and how we teach. In our schools, we are teaching our children how to think, how to do math, how to read, how to write, what science and biology are. We believe and celebrate the scientific method.",0.0
False,,"It is a foundation of learning and discovery. By asking our students to be vaccinated, we are affirming science in action. There does seem to be a certain willingness to consciously disregard straight science and is a bit mystifying to me. It is mystifying to our students as well. They learn about the Great Flu epidemic at the turn of the century",0.0
False,,"that killed millions. They learn about the ravages of polio, that crippled hundreds of thousands just a few decades ago. As a school board member, and as the Education Committee, we should stand up for the scientific method we all learned in school. You ask a question, you do background research, you construct a hypothesis,",0.0
False,,"you test your hypothesis, you analyze your data, and you draw a conclusion. Members, we have done this many times over, with some of mankind's deadliest diseases. And we know how to stop measles, whooping cough and countless others. Vaccines are proven to stop these diseases, and that's what students learn also.",0.0
False,,"Our schoolchildren deserve to be safe and healthy, and to have an education that values science. This bill is another step in that direction. It makes the right choice, and it honors the work of science. I'm also proud that the School Board Association, representing all of our states' 1000 plus school districts, are in support of this bill.",0.0
False,,They will be here to state their support later today. The school community clearly recognizes what is in the best interest of our public schoolchildren. Please support SB 277.,0.0
False,,"Love following these students. Mr. Chair and Senators, Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association. Sorry I didn't get a letter here. We're in strong support.",0.0
False,,"When teachers live in the school district, they have a strong connection with the community, with the families, with the kids, and when folks are getting evicted, it's a real problem. We urge your support.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and Members, Tony Gonzalez, representing the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce.",0.0
False,,I'd like to thank Madam Speaker for introducing this bill which is great for business and great for consumers. All of the points I was planning on making have already been made and have been articulated in the analysis and with that I want to thank everyone for the bill. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Sawait Hezchias-Seyoum on behalf of Health Access California, in support.",0.0
False,,"- Daniel Savino, Association of Regional Center Agencies, also in support.",0.0
False,,"Randy Martin, Auburn, California. Financier of two abortions myself, I urge you to vote no.",0.0
False,,Erika Bustamante with Stanford University. We also have concerns with the bill for the reasons already stated by my UC colleague.,0.0
False,,"Good afternoon at the end of a long committee meeting that I hope will go quickly now. Thank you for taking the time to hear this today, Mr. Chair and members. Today, I'm presenting two bills. The first one is 1193. Oops, my talking points just went away.",0.0
False,,"It's dealing with a law called Laura's Law, otherwise known as Assisted Outpatient Treatment. It's an evidence based treatment program that in certain circumstances provides treatment to those who have a severe mental illness.",0.0
False,,There are many criteria that must be met before a person with a mental illness may qualify for AOT including endangers to themselves or others and multiple hospitalizations due to mental health issues.,0.0
False,,The purpose of AOT is to keep people with severe mental illness in the community and in the least restrictive environment by providing additional support by supporting someone so that they may remain in the community.,0.0
False,,"We don't think that threatens anybody's civil rights because it is much better than often times being hospitalized and or incarcerated. Since its passage, AOT has been implemented in nine counties across the state of California, and this bill will encourage more counties to implement AOT but will not require that.",0.0
False,,"So, currently there is a continuum of mental health issues. The most non-restrictive, of course, just being voluntary outpatient. There is an intermediary where it is much more intensive.",0.0
False,,"And, then of course sometimes people have to be 5150'd and or hospitalized and or put into a conservator ship. This we think is a step before somebody has to be hospitalized, assisted outpatient which can be then court ordered.",0.0
False,,"And, we see more and more family suffering, patient suffering and I often use the analogy, often times mental illness itself will tell people I don't need any help, I'm okay, and to me it's somewhat analogous to someone having a leg cut off after a traffic accident and saying, no, no, no, I'm okay, I'm okay, just leave me here.",0.0
False,,"So we think this is an evidence based treatment program. It was based off a law, Kendra's Law, in the state of New York that has been in existence. It is strongly evidence based. Duke University has done a big study on it.",0.0
False,,"We see a reduction in hospitalizations, a reduction in self harms when this goes into place. And again, this is based on a case in Nevada City some years back where a young woman was working in a treatment facility.",0.0
False,,"Somebody came in, was not being compliant with meds, was not being compliant with treatments and in fact, ended up shooting and killing her. And this law then came in effect, again based on the New York law shortly after that in Nevada City, and now since then, nine counties across the state have adopted it.",0.0
False,,"When it was first implemented it was optional, counties had to opt in. And, because it's been slow to be adopted, and we think it's a really good, we've got enough evidence now to know that it works, that we'd like counties to be able to opt out versus opt in.",0.0
False,,"And even that process of being able to opt out, at least people are having the conversation. Mental health issues are one of those things, and as a licensed clinical social worker, I certainly have been on the end of having to hospitalize people and providing a lot of treatment.",0.0
False,,"I think this is something we don't talk about enough, and so we really hope this continues the conversation to provide a humane, evidence based approach rather than hospitalization, or often times putting people in jail...",0.0
False,,...Because we all know a large demographic of our people now serving time in jails and in prison have issues with mental health issues and we hope this provides a pathway to at least be able to bridge in between those two things.,0.0
False,,"So we have a lot of witnesses here in support today, and I would respectfully ask your aye vote when it comes to that time.",0.0
False,,Thank you very much. I'm glad to add you as a coauthor.,0.0
False,,"\We're glad to work with people, but the point is the bill is to go statewide and if counties want to opt out, then they would be able to opt out. So to take that amendment would, in essence, we'd be at status quo.",0.0
False,,"I just thank the committee for hearing this today, I thank people who came out on both sides, and I know there's been a lot of work over the years that has gone into this and just one thing I'd like to respond to, I am in no way saying that outpatient treatment that is not mandated is not effective.",0.0
False,,"It certainly is and we certainly have a lot of evidence that talk about all different kinds of treatment modalities that are very evidence-based and effective, but sometimes they're not when people don't comply with treatment or choose to take part in treatment.",0.0
False,,So that is for that demographic only. We're not forcing people who are already in voluntary treatment programs into anything else. I respectfully ask for you aye vote.,0.0
False,,"Thank you all very much. So, the second mental health bill you will hear today, and hopefully the last one, this one is dealing with the Lanterman Petris Act, LPS Act, which allows for involuntary commitment and treatment of an individual with a mental disorder.",0.0

False,,"The design work, as the Auditor stated, for release one, was inadequate. The scheduled time for testing was inadequate. And the costs were going to significantly increase, perhaps by hundreds of millions of dollars, if changes to the contract were not made. Many of the problems that were identified",0.0
False,,"were confirmed by the State Auditor and its report on BreEZe. By the time the audit was under way, we were already working on corrective action. That corrective action involved working closely with the Department of Technology to negotiate a new contract that would allow the state to better manage the project",0.0

Third, the Committees have recommended that we explain how BreEZe charges were calculated for Boards and Bureaus and SPR3.1, especially with respect to those Boards in the third release. In addition, the Department has been requested to share how those costs will affect license fees",0.0
False,,"and how any deficiencies will be met. The BreEZe project costs are allocated amongst the Boards and Bureaus based upon their respective share of DCA's overall annual initial license applications and renewals. Only the Boards and Bureaus in the first and second release will pay for the design, development,",0.0

The programs in the third release are only paying a share of the initial hardware, software investment costs and not the DDI contract. Although BreEZe may be a contributing factor,",0.0
False,,it is not solely responsible for fee increases at any of the Boards or Bureaus. There are many other factors that may contribute to a need to increase fees. We closely monitor the fund conditions of all of our Boards and Bureaus and have identified 17 whose funding is projected to drop below the three month reserve.,0.0

The other two options, namely stopping the project or pausing the project would have resulted in substantial financial cost to the State. As I mentioned previously,",0.0
False,,"we will do a cost-benefit analysis after the second release has concluded to determine how best to proceed for those Boards and Bureaus in the third release. Absent any findings to the contrary, our vision is still to bring those Boards and Bureaus into BreEZe. The Boards and Bureaus in the third release",0.0

We will not know whether those Boards and Bureaus remaining should receive refunds until after the cost-benefit analysis is completed",0.0

Five, I'd like to now turn to the Committee's question regarding the availability of Enforcement Reports and whether Boards have been given all the tools they need to extract the reports. The Enforcement Performance Measure's Reports is available to the Boards and has been",0.0

Given that, we have taken proactive steps to address and resolve their concerns. For example, we have convened a user group",0.0

These changes will be incorporated into BreEZe by the end of the fiscal year. The reporting tools currently available to the Boards include the ability,0.0

For more complex reporting needs, the Department has made its IT staff available to provide ad-hoc data sets to Boards upon request. These ad-hoc data sets request help address the immediate reporting needs",0.0
False,,"until the enhanced Enforcement Reports are available this spring. Finally, the Committees have asked how BreEze's enforcement functions are working, whether they are working better than Licensing, and if so, why? BreEZE is meeting the operational day-to-day needs of the Boards in the first release",0.0
False,,and is continuing to improve its functionality. Several enchancements are under way including the Enforcement Reports that I just spoke of which will improve its performance. The enforcement functionality is much easier to design than licensing functionality. That is because enforcement processes are similar,0.0

We'll provide written testimony regarding the other issues identified by the Committees in the background document. Again, Mister Chairman, Madam Chair,",0.0
False,,thank you for the opportunity to give these comments and I look forward to questions that these bodies may have.,0.0
False,,"The performance from Accenture on other contracts I can't speak to, I can only speak to the constraints that the current contract gave me to implement the very lessons learned that Caltech, Department of Finance, and my department extracted after release one. In order to really make those changes,",0.0
False,,"the current contract construct precluded me from implementing all of that. We realized that the current contract was not sustainable because we could not control costs or scope and it was completely unsustainable as we started getting into what the 19 remaining Boards,",0.0
False,,"some very complex, some very small, had in store. There was missing functionality from the original contract that we knew we would have to bake in and pay for, so that was part of the thought process.",0.0
False,,"It would be...That is premature to say it will be Accenture. The whole reason why the State is requesting to own the license to this code base, so we can be much more agile, have the code base, and then figure out what we need and then let the vendor, whether it's Accenture or somebody else, give us the best bid on how to integrate",0.0
False,,into our code base that we then own the license to.,0.0
False,,"Well, I would say the confidence should be drawn from the very action that the State has taken, thus far, which was quickly address the problems in the middle of testing, prioritize the solutions which is the very amendment that the Auditor spoke of, getting the Boards in release one the necessary fixes they need at a quicker rate.",0.0
False,,That is the amendment that we spoke of. The second part of that is the much larger amendment that is in question which is cutting off the contractual relationship to the third phase. The State would be remiss to continue on the current contract and continue racking up costs and putting my Boards and Bureaus fund conditions in jeopardy.,0.0
False,,"So although, it is a completely undesirable position that we're in given the current contract construct, what has happened, the best course of action is to pause, figure out a better course of action on how to implement the remaining Boards.",0.0
False,,"The testing phase was definitely a time when we explored all of our options with Caltech. The option to terminate, the option to cure, and the option to go forward and use the contract to the best of our abilities were the three scenarios that we were given. The unfortunate circumstance was that Accenture, because of the conditions",0.0
False,,"and the requirements in the contract, Accenture was able to meet the contractual requirements. The problem was those contractual requirements did not meet the needs of our business. That is exactly why we had an 11 month testing window when our Boards in the first release pretty much redesigned the system. So, I'm not gonna speak for",0.0

False,,I completely understand.,0.0
False,,"The actual ... The actual cost, if I understand your question, Chair, is the cost of the delay of the Special Project Report and the Section 11. That cost is determined by direct negotiations with my colleague, Mr. Ramos, and his department and the vendor. The, those started February 26. Shortly thereafter, the delay,",0.0
False,,"and Mr. Ramos was successful in getting a price, not a cost, which is completely different, a price per day, or price per month, towards the state, until the end of March, I believe. The reason why I wanna draw your attention on cost versus price is, price is negotiated, cost is the direct cost that the vendor is incurring. And those are two different things.",0.0
False,,"We actually have that. We have the hourly breakdown of how much per person, per hour, it costs for them to be at DCA.",0.0
False,,The price is approximately 1. ... 2. ... 1.2 per month. The price for the delay is around 2.5 million.,0.0
False,,Sure.,0.0
False,,"Absolutely the culture has changed. You know, we're not, we're not making knee jerk reactions with regard to any decisions that have been made. The cost that we put out there with regard, it was worst case scenario. It was in the event that Accenture decided--",0.0

False,,"I would submit to this body that everything that we have done since we have found the problems has been very deliberate, and we have done everything with the state's best interest in mind.

False,,- My colleague brought up a very good point which is something we realized. Even before the testing phase in release one which is very far back.,0.0
False,,Expecting boards and bureaus to understand what they need to change in their own internal operation to meet a new system that they have never seen before and has problems with requirements was unfair at best.,0.0
False,,So one of the largest lessons learned in addition to the design methodology that we've improved has been a changed management contract.,0.0
False,,It is absolutely essential as we're taking boards and bureaus who are on pretty much a green screen system into a brand new web-based system that's mouse based and we need to walk them through where in their business process they can change glean efficiencies.,0.0

False,,"- No, the 86 million for termination would be essentially that, in the event we had to terminate and go into a cost scenario, that's what the financial and programmatic exposure would be to the State. That is a separate cost analysis that we did.",0.0
False,,"- No, it's not. It's either, or.",0.0
False,,- You're welcome.,0.0
False,,"- If I could Mister Chairman, absolutely after the cost-benefit analysis is conducted and we look at various ways of how to integrate, there will be costs associated with that, however, the way we are seeking to position ourselves is to directly mitigate costs.",0.0
False,,"There could be some programs that we can integrate with internal staff. Smaller boards, less configuration problems, very little risk associated with data conversion.",0.0
False,,You juxtapose that to Contractor's Board which may require additional support and everything in between. So the way the State is seeking to position itself is to directly mitigate that risk and not get into the position that we're in currently.,0.0
False,,"- [Kidane] I appreciate that comment, because that is exactly what we're doing or what leads to. Change management is absolutely crucial. That's where my department fell down.",0.0
False,,With not incorporating change management in conjunction with the rollover of a major IT project.,0.0
False,,"The second is the proximity of training, which is robust. We have a lot of curriculum, but the proximity of the training to the actual roll out, and that's where we missed the mark on that one.",0.0
False,,"It's like preparing for a game. If you train for the game too far away from the actual game, all of that training is for naught. So what we're doing is, as if the schedule of the release moves, so does the training.",0.0
False,,We did not do that with the first release. So those two components will help the human aspect and the culture aspect of this release two as well as giving us enough forethought for what we do with the remaining clients in release three.,0.0
False,,"[Kidane] If I could buttress up what my colleague said, specifically to my department. Those milestones are absolutely vital to the health and safety of this project or I would submit, any project.",0.0
False,,"Specifically to Breeze, what we learned as I stated, the original problem was the contract and the anemic requirements in that contract that led into not enough time in testing, a design that was based on those initial requirements.",0.0
False,,Therefore we needed 11 months in the testing phase. All of those issues have been remedied in the amendment that we're speaking of We have a rigorous design process that my boards and bureau in release two have enjoyed.,0.0
False,,Very detailed methodology that went into their design. We have more time and quality controls even before the boards go to the testing phase.,0.0
False,,The department will run tests independently of the boards to make sure that what we ask for is essentially there.,0.0
False,,"We also have more time in testing for end-to-end testing So, what I'm saying essentially, the milestones that you accurately point out, we have baked into this new contract as lessons learned.",0.0
False,,"- Yes. I want to qualify the answer in that yes, there was no baseline design. The auditor is absolutely correct.",0.0
False,,"There was not, what we have now, which is here is what the state is asking for, therefore please develop scripts and test against this and see if it passes. We did not have that.",0.0
False,,"The fluctuations in design that was evident to everybody was because during the testing phase, the product did not meet the business needs of the boards and bureaus.",0.0
False,,"So, the irony is, we did not have a baseline design, therefore, we could make fluctuations in that product without the state being charged.",0.0
False,,"We did not have a contractual baseline therefore you saw wild fluctuations in the design to better meet the business need. The problem in that is, you're defeating the very purpose of what a testing phase is.",0.0
False,,"A testing phase is, you're supposed to have a set parameters of a design and you test against that, and you simply say ""does it work or doesn't it work"".",0.0
False,,"If it does not work, you have provisions in the contract to hold the vendor accountable. So, that's the only difference that I see in what happened.",0.0
False,,- The per month price from Accenture is around 1.2 million. What happens after March is predicated on conversations that Director Ramos has with the vendor in the event we need more time.,0.0
False,,"- No no no no, more time. I'm sorry, I thought the question was in the context of the delayed section 11, etc.",0.0
False,,Absolutely. So if there is more time needed past the end of March then the price of that is predicated on what the conversations that CalTech Director Ramos has with the vendor.,0.0
False,,"Similar to what has happened thus far, going from the February 27th to where we are now, will be similar to that.",0.0
False,,"- Awet Kidane, Director for the Department of Consumer Affairs.",0.0
False,,"- Thank you Mr. Chairman, Madame Chair. Before we start today and discuss the Consumer Protection Enforcement Initiative, I really want to reiterate my own personal commitment and the commitment of the department to ensure that we have the most efficient disciplinary process possible.",0.0
False,,"As I mentioned earlier, Consumer Protection is the department's mandate, we cannot go back to the days before CPEI, when an average of three years to take disciplinary action was considered good enough.",0.0
False,,That is wholesale unacceptable to me. We look forward to a continued partnership with this committee and with the rest of the legislature as we continue our efforts.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Gomez here, my Deputy Director for Enforcement, has been working diligently to keep our efforts on the right track, and with that, I would gladly like to turn it over to him.",0.0
False,,"- I do wanna underscore what Mr. Gomez said. The reports issue that I previously spoke of gave Mr. Gomez a opportunity to create some standardization across a lot of the boards, and that.",0.0
False,,"In order for the metrics to really mean something, we have to understand, we need to make sure we're counting an orange and an orange and an apple and an apple.",0.0
False,,"So to Mr. Gomez's credit, he and the user groups were heavily engaged in developing what those standards are and what they count for, that way as we measure ourselves, we understand what the metrics mean, and we then hold ourselves accountable.",0.0
False,,"- [Awet Kidane] Mr. Chairman. What my colleague said is absolutely correct regarding the metrics, use of the metrics, and the vision of CPEI and how it is just as, if not more important, where we are now.",0.0
False,,"However, we are developing the means to completely revamp it using data.",0.0
False,,"What metrics actually mean to each of the boards, and to make sure those metrics are meaningful and something that not only we can defend, but is based in fact. As we do that, we'll keep this body informed of where we are through that process.",0.0
False,,"Thank you. Sharon Rapport with the Corporation for Supportive Housing. Under Bringing Families Home, the Department of Social Services would select counties to participate in the grant program.",0.0
False,,"And though both, as Mr. Bauters mentioned, both the child welfare system and the homeless systems intersect, they're not aligned in addressing the challenges the families face.",0.0
False,,So some of the funding would go toward funding county positions for liaison to break down the silos between these two systems.,0.0
False,,The bulk of the funding though would go for housing interventions. Counties currently are developing or already have in place systems to assess a family's housing needs if they're homeless. And the bulk of the funding would go for getting the right housing interventions for these families.,0.0
False,,"It would fund things like housing location assistance, services that promote housing stability, and rental subsidies for three months to five years, depending on the needs of the families.",0.0
False,,"Counties would match the funding dollar for dollar, so they would be leveraging local and federal funding for this program, and we estimate that this funding, this $10 million combined with the local funding, would serve between 400 and 600 families. We know, based on evidence, that getting these families into housing not only ends their episodes of homelessness but also prevents foster care placement and reunifies families more quickly and that there are fewer incidents of recurrence of maltreatment or the problems that led to foster care placement.",0.0
False,,They also promote employment and educational opportunities as well as health stability. So we ask for your support for this budget item. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Jeff Vaca representing the California Association of School Business Officials in support of the bill.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and Members, Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association. CTA is in support of Assembly Bill 753.  In a county office, if a school district does not have a need for these education professionals in the coming year, they should utilize the lay-off process just as larger districts do.",0.0
False,,"For this small community of employees, to deny them permanent status, is hurting our students, especially those who are most in need of consistency. I do want to defer my time to an educator who is directly impacted here and we hope you'll support this proposal.",0.0

False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association. If I was going to seek a ways to eliminate charter schools in California without simply going to the California Charter Schools Act and repealing it, I might choose an approach like AB 787.",0.0
False,,"And that may sound like hyperbole, but let me explain why that is not hyperbolic. Talking about 1,184 charter schools in the State of California, who in one fell swoop, when 787 is adopted, if it's adopted, would be required to have their boards of directors appointed by their school district authorizer.",0.0
False,,"We understand the law is written to create in the petition process, an opportunity for the charter school to nominate the members of the board, and that the school district would then select from that list. But let's be honest with each other, there is a lot of negotiation that occurs in the petition process.",0.0
False,,"There are things that school disctricts put forward to the charter school that have basically said, if you want us to approve your petition, we want you to do these things. There are school disctricts, I guarantee, today, that, if this was the law, would say, if you give us 10 names, or 20 names, that we agree with, then we'll approve your petition.",0.0
False,,"But if you don't, then it'll be rejected. Those things are happening today on other petition elements, and would happen, I'm sure, in some cases, not all, but in some cases would happen with this new petition element. So it's very troubling to us that the autonomy and the independence that characterizes the charter school movement in California could be effectively wiped out by this bill.",0.0
False,,"The proponents and the author have suggested there are substantive reasons why this bill needs to be enacted. I heard the representative from the California Labor Federation, which I appreciated, talking about a lot of great charters, and also talking about some bad actors.",0.0
False,,"We know that's the case as well. But in advocating for this bill, what they have not done, is say why the board composition problem is the problem. And why it needs to be fixed. They raised the issue of CAVA. So CAVA is a single charter school, or 11, depending on your perspective, out of 1,184, that is having a dispute over the question of organizing its teachers.",0.0
False,,"A question that is currently before PERB. PERB has not acted yet. They have had hearings, but decisions are expected in the next few weeks. We don't anticipate that those decisions have anything to do with this bill, nor do we suspect that PERB is going to undermine the very explicit law that currently says the Education Employment Rights Act applies to all charter school employees.",0.0
False,,"So rather than suggesting that PERB is going to create a crisis, why don't we wait and see what PERB says, and if there is a problem, let's all sit down and figure out what that appropriate solution is. They've also raised the spectrum of the National Labor Relations Board.",0.0
False,,"There is an opinion issued by NLRB for California, for California charter school teachers that dates back to 2006, and is still the opinion in California, that California charter school employees are governed by EERA. They are not governed by NLRB.",0.0
False,,"They will point to a Chicago case, in which NLRB found differently, that case was vacated by the US Supreme Court, it was dismissed by NLRB, and has never been re-filed. It's never been re-submitted. That case no longer exists, it technically does not exist. So pointing to that case, and claiming that that's the reason why NLRB is poised to jump into California and make all charter schools private makes absolutely no sense.",0.0
False,,"And last argument that's been raised, not so much at this table today, but certainly in the analysis, is the reason why AB 1531was introduced last year. And that was to deal with a crisis between IRS and PERBS. I don't want to get into the details because that issue was resolved.",0.0
False,,"And resolved in favor of charter schools and their teachers. And PERBS is already working in the two months since that decision was handed down, working to make sure that all charter schools that applied to be in PERBS, will be allowed to be in PERBS, and those that were denied, nine or 10 from last year, will be back in.",0.0
False,,"We are very comfortable with the IRS decision, the IRS is very comfortable with it, and PERBS is very comfortable with it and has communicated that explicitly to this committee. So there are three reasons given, none of which have any foundation in terms of crisis or urgency that needs to be handled by this bill.",0.0
False,,"And I would simply point out, two things, finally. One is that changing the board structure has absolutely nothing to do with EERA it has nothing to do with CAVA, it has nothing to do with NLRB, and it has nothing to do with PERBS. It has a lot to do with the independence and the autonomy of charter schools, and what makes charter schools unique.",0.0
False,,"And yeah, we can have boards appointed by the school district, but at that point, they might as well just become district schools, which is what some charter schools are. They are still governed by the board.",0.0
False,,"I also want to just say, with some sympathy, to the teachers who testified, I mean, we hear problems like that, and you're not the only school that has problems like that.",0.0
False,,"But the big question is, where's the school district authorizer in that case? Why is the school district not stepping in, and saying, ""Why are you not hiring clerical staff?"" Why are you not doing the things that are necessary, and the things that you said in your petition that you were going to do?",0.0
False,,"That's the responsibility of the school district to do, and not the responsibility of a law change like this, in order to accomplish that. So for those reasons, I would ask for your opposition of this bill.",0.0
False,,I do have some things that -- we're going to have some folks just do me too's. But they do have written testimony if I could ask the Chair's indulgence to ask the Sargeant to distribute these so you can --,0.0
False,,We got some me too's as well.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, members, Nancy Chaires Espinosa, on behalf of the California School Boards Association. We must respectfully oppose this bill. The issue in question has a solution. It has multiple solutions under existing law. First, if the boundaries of the school districts don't meet the needs of the people that they serve, they can reorganize",0.0
False,,"those boundaries within existing law, and of course, there is the existing inter-district transfer process, which as the author mentioned, in most of these cases has already been granted. So, people who live here are not forced to quote borrow addresses. The issue does in fact have a solution, which, as evidenced by the testimony given,",0.0
False,,"has been working in favor of most of the people who have requested it. There are some more, some broader, more troubling issues here. This bill would impose upon the ability of the districts to plan for successive years. It would effectively be a mandatory open enrollment, so without being able to reliably project their attendance in out years,",0.0
False,,"they wouldn't be able to reliably plan for facilities, staffing, and all of those various issues. Further, this bill would set a troubling precedent by saying that the authority of a local educational agency would have to take second place in comparison to other parts of the local government system, specifically here in municipal government.",0.0
False,,"And, we really think that it would be inappropriate for the Legislature to presuppose what these decisions should be. The district has been making those on a case by case basis. So, we respectfully request your opposition to this measure.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Jeff Vaca with the California Association of School Business Officials, and with my colleague Estella Mue from the California Teachers Association, representing the education coalition.",0.0
False,,"On the topic of shifting child care into the Proposition 98 guarantee, the coalition has had many robust conversations about this topic this year. Historically, we have opposed shifting non Proposition 98 programs to being included within the guarantee.",0.0
False,,"We maintain that position this year. We hope that's not interpreted as a value statement about the importance of adequately funding childcare, but rather a statement of concern that over time as those cost increase within the Prop 98 guarantee that it will impact the ability of local education agencies to provide academic programs that allow California's students to achieve the goals for students and achievement that we all hope for them. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Kevin Aslanian, Coalition of California Welfare Rights Organizations. We also support putting the money into, taking out of Prop 98. And we also want to remind the committee that CalWORKs recipients are still living under 21 or 31% of the poverty level.",0.0
False,,And if they're going to use childcare they need to be able to pay their rent and that's starts the last week of the month in order to become self-sufficient. Thank you.,0.0

False,,"I appreciate your passion on this topic. I know you've worked really hard on it. In talking with a lot of folks in my agriculture community, people have put a lot of time and effort into trying to figure out how this works. This feels to them like, now we have to relook at everything. So I'm supporting it today, but I just think we need to keep looking at this before I vote for it on the floor.",0.0
False,,"Yes, I'd like to make a few comments and I'll be very brief. As chair of the California legislative black caucus, this has become a number one priority for us. And what has been interesting and I'll just pick up on this one point about diversity of ideas, being able to talk honestly with one another. To look at ourselves critically about where we are, but most important where we wanna go into the future.",0.0
False,,"And we even talked about body cameras and the court system, we can get into those. But the reason that I'm here now, why I got on this committee, because I still believe that change is gonna have to come from within the ranks of the rank and the file at the end of the day. You're gonna have to change the way you police in ways that during the 60s, it was dogs and fire hoses and a whole bunch of other atrocities that were done.",0.0
False,,"That was standard policing policy and then you evolved. Policing evolved and you got better. But I think it was because of that struggle between people having this dialogue was the best way to proceed and within the black caucus, what's been great is we do have these same kinda debates and we kind of side on more or less to the left. We need to do this. We need to have this kinda regulation. It is always interesting, which I find, actually I enjoy.",0.0
False,,"You'll see one or two hands go up or two or three members will call me and say, you know what? I used to be a police officer in a local police department. I used to be, I'm a reserve sheriff or I've had 25 years in the sheriff department. I see things just a little different than what you're looking at and I think that's very, very, very healthy. In fact, I think if we come together more and the black officers and come up with ideas, we may ultimately come up with solutions. Because now, we're interacting with actual public safety professionals to come up with remedies for what is going on. We need to have this kind of interaction, because at the end of the day, as you probably have now figured out.",0.0
False,,"Unlike Dr. Weber, I wanted to be elected official, because I thought the ones that I work for in the city of LA, I could have done a dam much better job than they could. And so I'm sitting there going, wait a minute. I need to get elected to fix this stuff and you don't want elected officials telling you what to do. If you don't want that to happen, then you gotta clean up your own house.",0.0
False,,"The reason we jump in, the reason we have these laws that you sit back and go why are you doing this, because you're not helping. And if you leave us up, just like your kids. If you leave them up to their own devices, you see what you're gonna get. And so I implore you to use this committee and other examples to come up with ideas. And I'll just leave you with this, even with body cameras, even just the idea of looking at the video before or after.",0.0
True,toxicity,"If you stand back and say, the public, forget about us elected officials, the public is concerned that the 1% might compromise that video, so that you can get away with murder. Not get away with something wrong, but literally get away with murder. And so when you come back to us and say, you know what? We can make our reports better, what we hear, the public, they hear, oh, you plan to cheat on a test, because you got a chance to look at the answers beforehand and you plan to cheat to make it better.",0.041394528
False,,"And so I'm gonna push it back to you to say, how do you keep that 1% from compromising something that might be a very good idea, which is body cameras. How do you plan to protect as a chief of the department? How do you plan to ensure that you get accurate information and you can use this as a tool for training, you can use this as a way to weed out the 1%, tell us.",0.0
False,,"If you remain silent and just say no, then we can't move, we can't even dialogue, if you're not giving us some response. And so what I'm imploring you to do, as we come up with these ideas, I would recommend you come up with the ideas of how to change and put some legislation in to make the system better, so that you can get rid of the 1% that is damaging your whole profession.",0.0
False,,"And I think you'll get a response, not only just from us, but most importantly, the public. There's a huge image problem right now and the best way to do that is to be proactive in making changes. And so again, I wanna thank Assemblymember Cooper for bringing you here, so we can continue this dialog. I think is ultimately at the end of the day, that's how we're gonna come up with the best answers. And the last thing I would tell you, the best answers I've gotten, I've said this in other committees, have come from law enforcement, especially African American law enforcement.",0.0
False,,"So this whole issue of diversity is really great. And in the corrections department, I've met with African-American correctional officers who have said, we have to change the culture. The culture of how we police and the culture of how we incarcerate. We've gotta get away from what, lock them up and throw away the key.",0.0
False,,"We've got to come up with more holistic way of dealing with this, so these guys don't come back. How do we ensure that they don't come back? And if it means changing the way you're trained, if it means then going back again to your culture and you have officers that think beyond kind of the Dirty Harry kind of approach. And get into that kindler, gentler officer or at least that, I like to say that smarter, brighter officer then let's get to that. And let's get to that pretty quick. So thank you, Mr. Chairman, for putting this together.",0.0

As many of you know, those are the drug courts, homeless courts, juvenile courts, and most important, our veterans courts. It's for local entities to draw down on those monies, so it'll be able to better help those who are most needed.",0.0
False,,"The thing that I'm most happy about it is the Governor's proposal for an 18 month amnesty, mainly because it sets the stage for the courts to go after about $10.6 billion in uncollected revenue. If this program has any success whatsoever trying to obtain about $150 million, what would it be like if we only got 10% of that 10.6 billion. We probably could help close the gap of the reductions that they've taken over several years. And so we will continue to work, not only with the Governor's office, but also look at other ways to get those unclaimed resources.",0.0
False,,"The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the other good news is the numbers have reduced. We're about 40,000 beds reduction, which means there's a reduction about $73.3 million to the CDCR.",0.0
False,,"Again, this very encouraging, not only are we reducing the number of beds, but we have probably got an opportunity, hopefully in the future, at brining the out of state beds back into California. We have people as far as Mississippi and Texas were housing prisoners, we need to bring them back home, once we get our numbers down. We need to do it cautiously. And, one day we may even be able to even close a prison, which has been unprecedented and never been done before. And I believe there's some talk about that.",0.0
False,,"In addition, in the Recidivism Reduction Fund, we're continuing to fund the community based organizations to the tune of 3 million. They're currently working on innovative programming outside of prisons. There's another 1.5 million in support of work force investment boards. They're the ones that actually find jobs for the formerly incarcerated, and they've been doing a phenomenal job at that. As we all know, once you get out or prison, if you're not able to work, you're not able to find housing, you're not able to get re-acclimated to society, you go back to what got you in prison in the first place. The WIB board are excellent tool in ensuring that they get some type of employment.",0.0

False,,"Also, for the first time, we're also providing $10 million support grant for community groups providing service to human trafficking victims. As many of us have been working on on our committee, one of the biggest problem that we right now have is human trafficking, it's taking us over like a tsunami. We need to provide, not only resources, but we have to provide resources in a unique way. This is not the typical type of crime that we've dealt with in the past, and so we have to handle this in a different way. Community groups are doing some innovative things to ensure that.",0.0

False,,"And then finally, there's about $5 million to support the implementation and enhancement of body cameras throughout the state. Where again, we're imposing a lot of body camera regulations on the locals.",0.0
False,,"Those locals who actually those communities that actually want to go out and do it on their own, I think we have a duty to provide them some kind of funding so they can at least get it off the ground, maybe even do their own pilot programs, and so, we're starting with $5 million to help with that effort, and I thank you.",0.0
False,,And I thank you.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, and just so you know, we heard from the chiefs and part of the challenge that both the Senate, and I will also say the assembly has, when asked how are these resources being used to help with the 109 and most importantly as we go into Prop 47, we really didn't get any definitive answers from law enforcement on that.",0.0
False,,"But just going with that, the senate totally eliminated it. The governor's office want to give them 40 million. The question is whether or not we have some type of accountability. Whether or not these strings are unattached.",0.0
False,,"After listening to Mr. Cooper and members from my committee, I felt it prudent to strike some kind of compromise. And so there is $20 million that has absolutely no strings on it. It's still problemental for me and several members of both the Senate and the Assembly on how it's being spent.",0.0
False,,"So what you see from the Senate, they're actually putting in what they think the money should be spent on, specifically. At least when it goes to conference committee and this is what I would suggest to the police chiefs, that you make very transparent what these moneys are being spent on and how it actually will help with the 109s and the realignment because I think that's what is needed when it gets to conference.",0.0
False,,"Right now, if you wanna look at it, I guess the police chiefs looks at it as half empty, I look at it as half full. And so depending on your perspective, the Assembly is probably taking the high road and is looking at it, starting to phase it to where it can actually be used for 109s.",0.0
False,,"And if they can come back as we go to conference and make a good compelling case for how this money is specifically being used to help with the 109s, I think once it gets to conference, you may get a better result then definitely on the Senate side.",0.0
False,,"The only discussion we had about cameras in cars was based on body cameras, being able to coordinate the two. Right now there are a lot of departments that already have implemented some type of cameras within their vehicles.

For example, all CHP officers' cars have some type of camera recording device.",0.0
False,,"Once an officer's out, how do we then connect that, so you get a panoramic view of what's going on? But we did not receive any requests.

False,,"Senator Frazier, thank you very much. Part of the answer to that question I think lies in what kind of, where we are in this state, what kind of home we're talking about, when it was built. We've seen, as different generations of homes get built, certain things are better and stronger and so that means other things would need to be fixed.",0.0
False,,"I'm certainly no expert in this area, nor do I claim to be, but under the existing program which is more in a pilot form.

False,,"But as I thought about what you were asking Senator Jackson, I thought a couple of things. One is that it is really hard to task just one agency or one program with that answer for those outcomes.",0.0
False,,"Because, as I think about the conversations that have happened on the first panel and, here about CalWorks, for example, you asked a really good question of the first panelists. How do we get the employment specialists who work with our CalWorks families to think differently about how we help them?",0.0
False,,"And I think part of that is on the way, in the sense that we are working toward this more broad based assessment tool. That we're really hopeful that the families that we're seeing still in our system who have not been able to achieve economic security with this fledgling recovery that we're still in, that we'll be able to better assess their needs.",0.0
False,,And as we're starting to pilot that we're finding out the needs are very robust. And how we serve those needs doesn't just come from the CalWorks program or from the social services system.,0.0

False,,"We've made some changes here in our CalWorks program, but now that the economy has picked up, we're finding that it's harder to get the folks who are left on CalWorks placed in those.",0.0
False,,"So I think one that is, I don't want to just throw up my hands and say though, but we can't be responsible for outcomes. To me then, I think it's It's a couple of things.",0.0
False,,It's about having a set of outcomes and goals that perhaps we're all working toward together. And we think about assessing changes to programs or the programs themselves across a variety of our departments and agencies in that view.,0.0
False,,"Maybe similar to what Great Britain did. If they had a, in that case, nation wide goal, maybe here there are some state wide goals that would help us all kind of have that eye on the prize.",0.0
False,,"And one thing that I wanted to say definitely would recommend be part of that, is that question of deep poverty.

False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, Jenny Bellow with the analyst's office. As your agenda indicates, both the Senate and Assembly's packages included some new funding for the State Long Term Care Ombudsman Program. Each adopted $1.4 million from special funds to increase monitoring in the state's long-term care institutions, such as skilled nursing facilities.",0.0
False,,The difference here is really that the assembly also provided 5 million general fund for the Long Term Care Ombudsman Program and we checked in with the department to give you a little context on sort of how that would translate. They estimate that they could hire roughly 85 new staff at the local level to provide these services.,0.0
False,,"And those staff would also be able to leverage hundreds of volunteers for the Long Term Care Ombudsman Program. They'd be doing more complaint investigations, but also more upfront monitoring of the facilities. And just one other note is this would be the first general fund that this program received since it was last cut in 2007-8.",0.0
False,,"Right. Prior to 2007-8, we did use general fund. And they also received some other special funding and federal funding.",0.0
False,,"They come from a state nursing home citations account, I believe.",0.0
False,,Thank you Mr. Chair. Jenny Bellow with the Analyst's Office. What you have in front of you here is an assembly proposal to make changes to the Case Management and Payrolling System for the In-Home Supportive Services Program.,0.0
False,,"As part of the coordinated care initiative several years ago, as you're aware, the In-Home Supportive Services Program became a managed care benefit in certain counties and the legislation that implemented the Coordinated Care Initiative allowed the managed care plans to augment In-Home Supportive Services hours on their own dime.",0.0
False,,If they decided that they wanted to provide more services for someone in their own home the issue really here is that they have been wanting to use the CMIPS II system or the Payrolling and IT system for In-Home Supportive Services to be able to track and pay for those hours and to also allow the recipients to use the same provider for those hours.,0.0
False,,So this change would facilitate that it would allow the managed care plans to utilize the system for those extra hours in line with legislative intent.,0.0
False,,"I think the administration may have an updated estimate of what they believe the actual cost is, but I think the total fund estimate of 7 million is reasonable. It may be an issue over breakout between general fund and federal funds being more of an 50/50 split. They could probably verify that.",0.0
False,,"I think just one other note that I would make for just context is all of the In-Home Supportive Services issues that you're considering today have implications for the same IT system, and so it may be something that as you land on these various issues, you direct the administration and let them know what your priorities are in terms of the ordering and the sequencing of these types of events.",0.0
False,,Thank you. I think we would just note that we're here to answer any questions you may have about the particulars of the proposals and estimates we receive from advocates about the number of people impact in that type of information if the committee should decide.,0.0
False,,"Sure, so as your agenda indicates, both the assembly and the Senate adopted where the governor started in January with the Senate's Trailer Bill Language. And then the assembly did 56 million of various investments in the foster care system. The first being $25 million for an additional recruitment in retention beyond that which the governor provided.",0.0
False,,"Another 20 million for the Transitional Housing Plus program. And that's an existing program. It's currently in 46 counties, so this would be an additional 20 million for that effort. And expand it also to homeless youth. They also provided nearly seven million for the Bringing Families Home project, which would be a pilot project.",0.0
False,,"That would put up funding for counties that were interested in matching that funding, and providing housing supports for child welfare service involved families. And they also provided 3.25 million for the Federal Strengthening Families Act.",0.0
False,,"And just one point of clarification here, it's not that the senate is not funding the Strengthening Families Act. It's that the action was to use existing funding, and what is called the Commercially Sexually Exploited Children's Program, to fund the Strengthening Families Act.",0.0
False,,"Whereas, the assembly augmented and provided 3.25 million to address some concerns from the counties. And that the committee heard related to whether or not that money from the Commercially Sexually Exploited Children Program was appropriate to use for this new federal mandate.",0.0
False,,"I have a hand out, if you're interested. So you can see the assembly provided a one time COLA to the SSP portion of the combined SSP grant that would be effective January 1, 2016. The cost in the budget year is estimated to be 33 million and that annualizes to about 66 million on an ongoing basis.",0.0
False,,"As the handout shows you, it walks you through sort of what would happen to the maximum SSI SSP grant under the assembly's action and you can see that the grant for individuals would increase by $4 while the grant for couples would increase by $10.",0.0
False,,"One thing to note here is that both for couples and for individuals currently, the SSP portion of the grant is at the minimum level allowable by federal law and going below that would actually mean we sacrifice all of our Medicaid funding. So that's where we are at now.",0.0
False,,"The last state funded COLA for the SSI SSP grant was in April of 2005, similar to the CALWORKS COLA item you discussed earlier, the automatic COLAs or the statutory COLA were eliminated in 2009.",0.0
False,,"We're not close to losing our federal match but if we were to drop our SSI SSP grants lower than they are now, that would risk the federal Medicaid funding, which is why we don't do it.",0.0

False,,"I won't disagree with anything that the speaker before me just said. Our concern is with the proposed solution and unintended consequences that it may have in shifting risk to the project owners, which in our case is local educational agencies.",0.0
False,,"So we will continue to work with the author, but at this time our position is still opposed. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"No we would actually agree with the sponsors characterization, it's not common to include these clauses in a contract and the reason for that is because we, as a project owner, can recover those costs whether or not we include that clause in the contract. So really, the more responsible thing to do is to not include that clause in your contract.",0.0
False,,"One of our concerns is that including those clauses and, in concert with this proposed language, it may muddy the waters. It may cause some confusion.",0.0
False,,"So perhaps a judge could say, you as the owner were able to recover these consequential damages, per statute, or per custom. But, unfortunately, you have voluntarily capped yourself, so that might lead to some confusion and that's something we would like to avoid.",0.0

In the past history of developmental centers in my lifetime as a lobbyist, we've closed Stockton Developmental Center.",0.0

False,,"Even though we were disproportionately saving the state money by moving people from the developmental centers, where the costs are quite high, into community-based programs. Which are very efficient. We didn't get the benefit of the property and assets that were left behind.",0.0
False,,"And we got absolutely no benefit from the operations dollars that suddenly just went right back into the budget. What Ms. Grove has done here is set forth, I think, a pretty landmark policy That says no more of that.",0.0
False,,"It says that these assets that have been dedicated for years and years, decades really, in serving people with developmental disabilities should be looked at in a way to help fund the community and their transition into the community.",0.0
False,,"And not just for the remaining thousand people that are left in developmental centers, but for the 280,000 that we attempt to serve everyday. In that way, the bill doesn't propose an increase.",0.0
False,,"It doesn't, in terms of what the state's obligation is, but it rather sets forth a priority that this community deserves our attention. And the other document I passed at you is a document that shows what the 12 recent most state budgets look like for this population.",0.0
False,,"You'll see that as Ms. Grove pointed out, one rate increased 2006-07 was the only rate increase that the legislature and governor have given in the last 12 state budgets to this community. Meanwhile, the cost of living went up 30% during that time period.",0.0
False,,"So where does the money come from? This bill helps address that and looks at, makes an important policy statement on that issue in terms of how we treat the assets, the property, and the operations dollars going forward in a way that will help to continue to serve this community just as it's done for decades and decades.",0.0

False,,"I think that part of the challenge that we've had with previous Executive Governors, where they don't want any undue burden on the courts and we will work with the court to ensure that this doesn't become either financial or an undue burden, lengthening court cases.",0.0

False,,"We have to figure out a way to let people know that and I think that, from the executive branch. I think we can show that it will not be an undue financial or exhaustive burden on the courts, especially if we just list it and have maybe someone sign off on it, but we do need to have some kind of consultation with the defendant to do that.",0.0
False,,So there's nothing in what you're proposing that's substantially different than what's been proposed in previous years then?,0.0
False,,"I'm not absolutely sure, but I can find out for sure and then get back to you. Okay?",0.0
False,,"That'd be great and then you did raise another option because I'm concerned about the broadness of this list and obviously we want a defendant to be aware of the consequences, there's no question about that.",0.0
False,,"But you just brought up another alternative which seems more attractive to me, which is to be able to present to the defendant a list as defined that allows them to sign off on it. So the court and everyone can be clear on that. That would seem to put less of a burden on the courts and more on the defense council to have reviewed that list.",0.0
False,,"Almost as if you were revealing a contract in a real estate transaction so that they could be clear about those consequences and then have a sign-off. So, that certainly seems a lot more attractive to me. That would seem to advance the worthy goals that you have put forward.",0.0
False,,But allows the court and everyone to be clear that the defendant is understanding the consequences. That is something that you would consider?,0.0
False,,"Yes and Senator Glazer, I'm trying to get this worthy goal done. I don't want the bureaucracy to weigh it down. So, as a former bureaucrat, I'm dedicated to ensuring that that doesn't happen.",0.0
False,,"So, for me and I'm new to this process, I'm comfortable with the bill as presented, but I think if there was a way to provide that same protection to the defendant with some sort of a check-off would seem to me something that I would encourage.",0.0
False,,"Part of this is that we don't and I know we're not supposed to go back and forth, but part of this is, with the governor I think is he likes for, the administration likes for the departments to come up with their own methodology.",0.0
False,,"I think once the courts embrace this, and they know that they need to do this, I think they will come up with a way to get this done where it doesn't impact them adversely. That's just one idea off the top of my head right here.",0.0
False,,"I see but Madam Chair, it does seem like we're directing the judge to take some specific action. Does that leave leniency to the judicial council as to how they implement it and would they be allowed to in the implementation of this bill as written, allow for a check-off to be worked out through their defense council?",0.0
False,,"I think, for me at least, this is going in the right direction. I don't know if it's appropriate to hear from the judicial council as to how they would interpret the bill as written or an amendment as suggested in terms of their ability to.",0.0
False,,"Well, Madame Chair, can I ask a more specific question? As I understand the bill, it says it requires the court to inform. So I'm not as aware of how that is traditionally done within the law. So, does it allow the court to inform through a check-off that's submitted to the defense counsel? Is that an option that the court would have?",0.0
False,,"So, Madam Chair, then to the Chair. The criticism was cost and if we're hearing that that somehow is avoidable, that adds more confusion, to me, at least. If we're trying to, again, the worthy goals of informing the defendant, but trying to avoid the costs, I'm not still clear about how we reconcile all that.",0.0

So this is why we came to this conclusion, so the five member or seven member police commission comes up with a determination that.

There's a lot about the grand jury that we don't know about and how they work and operate and I think this is very important.

False,,"And so while you move through this on a policy level, hopefully you're looking in the corner of your eye to make sure we also can have the money there to afford it, because the last thing you want to happen is, as we all know, we go through this whole process, and we get to the financial part, and then it dies.

We urge your support.",0.0
False,,"Good morning Madam Chair, Members. Good to be with you again. This is Nancy Chaires-Espinosa with the California School Board Association. I am going to attempt to have a little bit more of a fact based conversation. We've heard some really emotional language, and I will begin by pointing you to the committee zone analysis of the bill, the statement for the need of the bill.",0.0
False,,"If you look just at the facts, even in what some of us may consider the worst case scenario of applying this statute, the process worked. The district conducted an investigation. It came to a decision. It shared that information with the family. It stood corrected. It changed its decision and ultimately made the right decision. But what I think is really critical here is that we broaden our context.",0.0
False,,"This bill would not just affect the situation that brought this issue to light for the author. It would affect the entire state, so let's please consider this bill with that in mind. The typical situation is very different from the one that we've seen in Orinda. It's much more sophisticated families who trigger these investigations. It's much more common that it be related to sports, that people want to get their students into the right district and the right school for purposes of getting athletic scholarships, things of that nature.",0.0
False,,"So, in the universe in which a school may need to conduct a residency investigation it's typically a very different situation than the one we've seen. So I just I just wanted to make sure that we all start with that frame of mind. So, current law defines pupil residency requirements and regulations actually require school districts to verify pupil residency every single year. So we've talked a lot about it, I think there's been again colorful language trying to get motivation to the district for conducting these residency investigations.",0.0
False,,"I want to make very clear, it's actually our responsibility to do that. There are a few provisions of the bill that are a problem for us. The provision requiring the board to adopt the specified policy, I don't think we have a concern with the fact of the board creating a specified policy to address this. It's really the specific requirements and the level of detail that it goes into. So specific, articulable facts, I think a lot of us learned a new word with articulable.",0.0
False,,"It's a little bit of a problem, and I'm scratching my head a little bit when some of my colleagues with CTA and CFT are in support of this bill. I fear that they have not thought through the implications of this. This language may require the district to identify the individuals, the district employees who may have triggered the investigation. So, by not allowing the district to conduct to protect confidentiality, that's a problem for anyone who may provide information to the district, be they a district employee, be they a community member.",0.0
False,,"Once the word is out in the community, that if you participate in this kind of investigation, if you give an honest answer to someone from the district who is coming to ask you question about a student's residency, that you're identity will not be protected. That spreads pretty quickly. So that will seriously impair our ability to gather honest information from people.",0.0
False,,"Second, the requirement that anyone who is conducting this type of investigation, be it the district employee or someone working on behalf of the district, divulge the fact of the investigation is a problem for us. There is a benefit when you're conducting an investigation. To being able to gather all of your facts and then sharing them with the family. The reason for that is that people may not be truthful with you.",0.0
False,,"So the family, the parents, members of the community, if it's an aunt or an uncle and we're borrowing their address to enroll in what we think is a better district. All of these people are very well intentioned, and if it's clear to them that it's in their hands to lie and do what they think is in the best interest of their student, they will commonly do that. When you put that together with the fact that the list of documents that statute specifies that districts have to use as evidence for residency are very easy to falsify. It's very easy to get fake address onto those legal documents. We are left with photographic evidence.",0.0
False,,"So this bill would actually prohibit us from using photography or video. So once the district goes through it's process, either sends a letter or sits down and has a in person meeting with the family, commonly the parents will stick to their story. They'll continue to say no, no, no. This is where we live, this is where Junior lives who lives with his aunt, whatever the story is. And it's only the photography, and the video, that allow everyone to come to a consensus about what the real situation is.",0.0
False,,"So absent this very critical investigative tool, we are effectively unable to verify student residency in these situations, as the law requires us to do. And you know we've talked a little bit, the author suggested an amendment to actually define what the word surreptitious is and I understand the analysis represents that the bill doesn't prohibit photography, that it prohibits surreptitious photography, which could be defined.",0.0
False,,"I think any kind of photography that we need for investigative purpose could be described as surreptitious, even with the propose definition. So what we need is photograph that shows a student going into a specified location. It's difficult to capture all of that information if you're standing, you know, five feet away. So ideally, we would have to be, maybe, across the street. Or across the street, you know, behind a bush apparently is a problem, but what about next to a bush.",0.0
False,,"According to the definition that is proposed here by the author, it's still unclear because, what's the right distance? Could you be two houses down? Could you be half a block away? What is the definition of surreptitious and what is the definition of covert according to the proposal? It would introduce, actually, a greater level of confusion, opening up our districts to liability and impeding our ability to do our job, to implement this code section.",0.0
False,,"So with that I understand the situation, I ask of you to please not assume that some of our, some of our, I guess worst case scenario stories are actually typical of what's happening across the state. Please bear in mind the good actors, which is everybody else who is trying to implement this law and don't impede our ability to do that. So we respectfully oppose.",0.0
False,,Who do I represent?,0.0
False,,California School Boards Association.,0.0
False,,"So, well first I want to clarify, hope I didn't say usually that they're dishonest, sometimes they're dishonest. It's handled in different ways, but generally the process is that something has triggered the reason to believe that the student doesn't meet the residency requirements, that could be maybe you have documents that have different addresses, maybe an individual can use some information, something like that.",0.0
False,,"So you'd gather whatever information that you have and depending on the circumstances, if I think the typical situation, like what happened in Orinda the way it would typically be handled is that someone would speak to the family. In this case, clearly as was stated, it was not handled well.",0.0
False,,"If there is a reason to believe that there is a more, I'd say, intentional deceit, like in the more typical situation with athletics, you would probably want to gather your photographic and video evidence before letting the family know that you have a concern. And the reason for that is because it's very important not to give people an opportunity to make temporary changes in their behavior that would keep you from getting an accurate picture of what's happening. But yes, typically you gather your information, you talk to the family and that's the point at which you will make a final decision.",0.0
False,,"Emphatically, no. It is not. And that's really the point I wanted to make, that we step back from the situation that happened in Orinda to really consider the way school districts operate across the state. No, it is never grounds to do that. If I may address your previous question. The issue of harm, whether there is any harm to students with conducting the photography.",0.0
False,,"So it sounds very benign to say photography would take place in open and public view. I am actually concerned that that would be harmful to students. That is much scarier for a young child to have an individual in open and public view taking pictures of them. Or if they're not able to take pictures of them, having to talk to them ask them questions when it's a grown up they don't know. The result of this bill will result in harm to students. Current law, which allows an adult to be at a safe distance where a child will not see them, avoids that harm.",0.0

They are tested by third party labs against OECD standards that are the most stringent standards relative to persistence and biodegration.",0.0
False,,"Further, they meet those guidelines. As part of moving forward in our really, I mean truly good faith effort to try to address the concerns, work with the author  and proponents, we've put forth well over 20 sets of different amendments on the definition of plastic microbead over the course of the last year and a half.",0.0
False,,"Really, truly in a good faith effort to try and find that middle ground. Our latest proposed amendments that you have all seen really were our effort to try and address some of the concerns raised by the author and proponents around concerns about persistence and biodegradability, and what kind of guideposts and guidelines that would look to.",0.0
False,,"Again, OECD, as one example of a number of entities that have guidelines and standards in place, those have been in place for a number of years, decades I would even say, and that is, those are the types of standards that companies are looking to.",0.0
False,,"They are standards that use a variety of tests with river water, fresh water, marine water is part of those testing protocols. And anything that would come out of that testing protocol that would be fragmented or what have you, would not pass that.",0.0
False,,So the alternatives that they're looking at and requiring those third party entities to meet are actually such that they have to pass those tests for the companies to even consider them.,0.0
False,,"In terms of those amendments we provided to you, they were in a good faith effort to try and say, okay, there are guideposts in place that would potentially get to those concerns around persistence. Further, it's not often you have companies, industry-oriented entities coming to you and saying we're open to further regulation.",0.0
False,,"The language, again, was in a good faith effort to say, if California wanted to establish its own specific standards for these types of applications, that we would be amenable to that as well. Certainly we're open to a different approach on the language.",0.0
False,,I think part of the concern is we haven't made headway and the concerns remain the same as we have relative to that narrow piece. The microbead alternatives that we would be looking at.,0.0
False,,"In terms of also going forward with regard to peer review, these alternatives again do go through these testing protocols, and the testing protocols have been peer reviewed themselves, such that they use, again, fresh water, marine water as part of those testing procedures.",0.0
False,,"Its not just out of the tap, and just testing against non-related natural environment type things. That said, each natural environment is somewhat different based on sediment flows and what have you. So the testing protocols try to set up the best mechanisms to ascertain whether these types of applications would be workable based on those protocols.",0.0
False,,"So with that, unfortunately we must remain opposed unless amended at this time. But certainly, truly want to be able to make headway on this in terms of moving forward with cleanup next year. Our concerns are the companies are reformulating now.",0.0
False,,A number of the companies have already agreed to phasing out long before the deadlines contained in the bill which is certainly positive. Some companies may only have just one or two products to reformulate. Others have dozens.,0.0
False,,"And so taking sets of alternatives off the market, or out of the ability to use based on the language in this bill, will hinder that progress in a much more expedited fashion and leave us with very few alternatives, Potentially resulting in wide scale products coming off shelves entirely.",0.0

False,,"In that they had the technical expertise on these issue areas. Certainly, again, this amendment was truthfully, in an effort to try and have some sort of framework to work from. And in an effort to try address some of the concerns and provide some semblance of guide posts around the established standards that are already in place.",0.0

False,,"Not exactly the same but in terms of the details of those sorts of things, Green Chemistry was set up so that the scientists could establish the parameters for review of various chemicals and products. But again, we're happy to even look at additional different language.",0.0
False,,"The key here was, is that it was our intent and our best effort to try and have some kind of framework to go by, that would provide some guide posts and parameters. If it needs to be kind of a different framework that this, our interest is really that we're not cutting off the innovative, new technologies that are already commercially available,",0.0

False,,Thank you Mr. Hill I would just. I apologize.,0.0

False,,"And so again, these are the guidelines and standards already in place for talking about persistence, looking at persistence in biodegradability. And so again it was in that kind of frame of mind that we offered these, which was tried to get there.",0.0

False,,Okay. Thank you.,0.0

False,,"But this whole concept of these millions and millions of hours and hours of tapes that we have and we don't take advantage of using those hours as a training tool, kind of disturbs me. That it could be used as a punitive measure for the most part as opposed to, as opportunity to make better law enforcement officers.",0.0
False,,"And so I hope, as we move through this, that all of law enforcement and also the community will give managers, that are in law enforcement, an opportunity to use this footage as not something to beat officers, law enforcements over their head, but as an opportunity for them to get better, improve.",0.0
False,,"As you know, you give a speech, when you get in front of a mirror, that's and when you review later how you get a speech, you get better at it. I would hope that as you start to interact with the public, people can come through, especially they're just supervising, give them pointers on how to interact better, so that they get better at it over a long period of time, especially if you're looking at a million hours worth of tapes just in LAPD alone.",0.0
False,,"Hopefully 99% of that is about improving law enforcement, not 99% of it is looking at what has happened with some bad actors. And in part two is my question. Hopefully you heard LAPD speak about their procedures, which they probably gave more about what happens when there's an unfortunate incident, especially firearm, someone getting shot, someone getting killed.",0.0
False,,"It appears to me that there's an unbelievable process that one law enforcement officer has to go through. It's not just, write a report and it's over. I have a feeling from what I've heard today, and hopefully you've heard, there's not only internal affairs, you have to be interviewed by probably several officers and command officers.",0.0
False,,"It's not just write a report and then that becomes the sacred cow. There's a lot of interrogating that goes on with that and for the first time, I got a feel for that, and I got a feeling if we were to, without getting into an officer's Bill of Rights, but if we were to get into what is the actual process that an officer who has the unfortunate opportunity to discharge their weapon, what they go through.",0.0
False,,"And if the public were to see how intense that investigation could be, do you think they might have a little more trust in the system that they're looking at now, where allowing an officer to review the tape before they write a report. Knowing that, they will go through some intense scrutiny, if that happened.",0.0
False,,"Or because you're members of Policy Link, NAACP or ACLU, do you think that the process now is not intense enough that the body cameras will add a window to it? What, right now, there is a process in place that doesn't seem to give you comfort that will get to the truth and you're looking for body cameras to ultimately get there.",0.0
False,,Get where I am going?,0.0

I'm hoping that the Highway Patrol of California still has the best policies and procedures worldwide.",0.0
False,,"So I'm just gonna put that in there since I'm advocating for them to have it. But most important, both the Highway Patrol Association and the management for Highway Patrol rank-and-file are fully working together to integrate and make sure that we come up with something that actually works.",0.0
False,,"So my question for both of you or one of you, I know highway patrol has had car cameras. And I guess you've had some usage with cameras. This whole discussion about having an officer do the report before they view the camera.",0.0
False,,"Have you prosecuted or found, especially when use of force is being done, have you had incidents where you've discovered that their recollection and what they were doing, they kind of concealed?",0.0
False,,"Now I'm talking about the 1%, I'm not talking about the 99%, so let's not everybody get all crazy here. But at the end of the day, you do have some officers that may want to corrupt the report. And have you, for lack of a better word, busted some and found that the tape was instrumental in ferreting out the truth? Which is what we're really trying to get to, in real life.",0.0
False,,"So in my questioning I was trying to get to that whole point that there's a whole process that an officer goes through when there's an incident. If when a body camera you show, you can see an officer shooting someone in the back six times. I would think you may not allow that person to write a report before they do that. To your point, that shouldn't be the case. If it looks like it's a criminal act, that they then become criminals. And they have a different procedure.",0.0
False,,"And so when I was asking about internal affairs with the previous panel. Or when I was asking, have you prosecuted anyone from doing anything malicious with the report, I don't think they thought about the whole process of the investigation including the DA's office and judges and juries. Obviously right now there is not a whole lot of faith in grand juries or DAs, also right now. So we're not here to have that discussion right now.",0.0
False,,"So the whole system right now is under siege as far as accountability. And so when it comes to having faith in the system, the suggestion you made that when it's a criminal act that maybe this should not be perceived as a regular routine type of traffic stop, especially when someone dies and there's a shooting. And I think that may help us move forward with, whether or not we do reports before or after. And so I, that's an interesting suggestion you made about doing that. And so, how do we move forward with that when it seems like, as if law enforcement is against it? Is this something that the DA's office would recommend or think about doing?",0.0
False,,I know.,0.0
False,,"Thank you for the information on body cameras, and investigative records, and hopefully, you can keep us abreast of what that is, how that's proceeding.

Who's gonna notify them and give them the ability to have their voice be heard in the process? That's what I'm failing to see in this proposal.",0.0
False,,All right. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Thank you. I support many of the intentions of the bill, in terms of notifications, and in terms of extending the statute of limitations, but where I was having trouble was putting the burden on the person making the contract, versus putting it somewhere else that might be more appropriate, including the state. If someone is paid for their story in some fashion, isn't that a reportable event to the state? And if so, isn't that a better burden to place on our behalf, in terms of the notification than it is on a private individual?",0.0
False,,"But the trigger is the financial contract and I'm asking if the trigger was payment with the state. Therefore, they have knowledge of that and have the data that there is a restitution issue in play.",0.0
False,,"And that's for me, where I think I'd find a more supportive place at least for me at least would be to create a burden on us rather than the burden on a private individual that may not have any knowledge of the systems. I mean, if a state agency isn't talking to another state agency, that's our responsibility. But to communicate the obligations within this bill to anyone that's out there, that might engage in this conversation with someone who is a perpetrator of a crime, it just seems like I want this effort to be successful.",0.0
False,,"I want victims to have the ability to seek restitution and I also would like victims to have the ability to have as much notification as reasonable. And so, I'm trying to identify maybe a different trigger that could be in play that would allow you to achieve the goals in which you and that's why I'm having trouble.",0.0
False,,"Just to be clear, I don't mind putting an additional burden on the perpetrator. I'm trying to say, if that person is compensated, the issue is seeking restitution. It comes from a form of compensation and that's a taxable event. It requires under our current tax law, notification of the state either through a 1099 or some other notification that person has been paid. That seems to be a place in which we could make sure that our interests are aligned in terms of awareness of that perpetrators, potential for restitution.",0.0
False,,"And therefore, that's a place that can then go through the notification system, so that a victim has an opportunity to seek restitution. That's all I'm saying. It seems like that's a clearer track to me than to somebody out there who may be having a conversation with someone on a book deal or a movie deal, that somehow they would know all of our laws and obligations that would come of that outside of the tax laws. It just seems like that's maybe not as effective. I 'm trying to find a way that would be more effective.",0.0

False,,"Yeah, so I was on this committee last year when we heard this bill. And, some people were here, some people weren't. But, we were sitting here, I was actively taking care of my sister-in-law who had been diagnosed with cancer and died within a short, two month period of time.",0.0
False,,"And partly because she had no health care insurance, she didn't have access to healthcare. Her only access was in through the emergency room.

False,,"But when it comes down to it, sometimes you have to try to find a way to find that middle ground to thread that needle for the good of many of our communities who are tragically, medically, under served. So it seems to me that for the most part, people agree that nurse practitioners,",0.0
False,,"in their scope that they're already trained for, in their scope that they already practice in. That we all seem to agree that, that is probably a good thing, that we need to move it forward.

False,,"It really is, should nurse practitioners who choose to be independent be able to be a hospital employee? That's what we're talking about. That is a very simple, small thing.

False,,"What this bill is truly saying is dream big and think outside the box. But don't abuse the public trust and spend that money on our children, spend that money on our students.

False,,"I appreciated hearing the testimony from the attorney from CTA, because it gave you a good primer on how 1090 works for elected officials. But keep in mind, notwithstanding other assertions up here about us being public schools, we are public schools that are operated by nonprofits.",0.0
False,,"And nonprofits operate in a somewhat different world. It doesn't mean that they have any less interest in protecting the public funds, but they need to do things differently than elected officials. You are governed by 1090, but I would dare say that not one of you is prepared",0.0
False,,"to take out a personal loan at no interest or low interest to help fund the State of California. I think the same is true of boards of supervisors, the same is true of city council members, the same is true of school trustees. That's not true with charter schools.",0.0
False,,Charter school board members actually step up to make sure that their doors stay open. The Legislature and the governor deferd payment to schools including Charter Schools for several years during the recession. School districts had many options to bridge that gap until the recession was over and the money was restored.,0.0
False,,"Charter schools did not have those same options. We had board members who were stepping up and making loans to charter schools just to keep the door open. Low interest, no interest, it doesn't matter if there's a financial arrangement between the board member and the charter school. Under 1090 it would be prohibited and the person would be criminally liable.",0.0
False,,"That is far in excess of what the needs are in terms of conflict of interest. If you have a board member of a charter school who has a facility that he thinks, and the school thinks, would be ideal for the school. And is willing to give that facility for $1 a year to the charter school, 1090 would prohibit them from doing so.",0.0
False,,"We agree that there needs to be financial integrity. There are ways of ensuring that without imposing such an absolute prohibition as 1090 entails. We have oversight by school districts, we have other laws. Don't dismiss the corporation's code as being too light on board members.",0.0
False,,"It's not. I mean there are self-dealing laws in the corporations code that are very clear about what board members can do and can not do. And they are for the benefit of the charter school, not for the benefit of anybody else.",0.0
False,,"We think there is a deal to be had, we have asked that people get together and push forward with three-quarters of the Bill.

False,,"Absolutely, thank you for the question Dr. Pan. I think that there are two ways of answering that. One is that there is current law under 47605 as you'll see I pointed out earlier. The responsibility of the school district is to oversee all of the charter school, including it's financial activities.",0.0
False,,"And that includes these kinds of loans and the activities of the charter school in terms of what they do on a day to day basis, and on an extraordinary basis, as had to happen during the period of referrals. So, that's all ready occurring.",0.0
False,,"We also think in the other pieces of this bill is going to add additional scrutiny and transparency that we find very helpful. So the Brown Act makes sure that, even though a lot of charter schools are already doing the Brown Act, it would make sure that all charter schools are doing all of these activities totally in public at a public hearing that's noticed and agendized and the issues are on that agenda.",0.0
False,,"In addition, Political Reform Act requires, as I said earlier, form 700 to be filled out by all of its board members. So all of the financial information about those board members, just like you Dr. Pan and Senator Vidak is gonna be very transparent, very public.",0.0
False,,"So I think there's a lot of good things in terms of transparency in this bill, but we also believe that 47605 is, it's pretty clear about ensuring that transparency, as well.",0.0
False,,"Doctor, If you don't mind mine answering one more way and that is that 1090 is not a transparency provision of law because it is scorched earth as you've already heard. There's no transparency. The transparency comes in the other parts of the bill. That's important to make that distinction.",0.0
False,,"Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association, proud to co-sponsor, urge your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Madame Chair, members Rand Martin on behalf of California Charter Schools Association, when this bill passed out of assembly appropriations, we immediately went to Mr. Hernandez and said, you know what, we actually support in concept, the balance of the bill which deals with the for-profit issue.",0.0
False,,"Now we would like to work with you on language that clarifies what operated by and operated as means. When currently as one sentence, it is open to substantial interpretation by the state, by school districts, by for-profits and non-profits.",0.0
False,,"We've provided them with language which we thought was plenty of time before the policy deadline for their consideration. Which simply does define operated as and operated in by. And the most important distinction it makes is, it says that if you're a for-profit and you have one of three things, you govern the budget of the charter school, you employ its teachers and other employees, or you have governance control of the charter school, then you cannot operate in the state of California.",0.0
False,,"Those are three key elements of what governance and control of a charter school is. So if you do any one of those, you would not be able to operate. With that language, we would support the bill. We think it is a policy that deserves to be part of the California Charter Schools Act.",0.0
False,,"Unfortunately, those amendments have not been accepted, and the bill in print is what's before you. We think it opens up a lot questions about what it actually means. Not only for charter schools, but extension as Mr Jones indicated, to traditional school districts who are also contracted for services that could be construed as operated as, or operated by, but are not being held to the same standard as charter schools.",0.0
False,,"Again, we urge the committee to accept the amendments that we've shared with each of you and with the author and move the bill forward in that form. This is the last chance.

False,,"Another way to look at this however though, is that people moving out of developmental centers into the community will save the state money and we have proof of that. The budget you just passed included a very clear reference to $64 million saved due to the closure of the Lanterman Developmental Center from people moving out of a developmental center and in the community.",0.0
False,,"$64 million was saved. We got none of that money back, and in fact, over the past eight years, we've documented now that this system and the community-based system has saved the state of California $400 million from people moving out of developmental centers into community-based programs.",0.0
False,,We haven't received a penny of that back. The other thing I did that I wanted to point out is I just gave you a couple of charts because this speaks to you a couple of the facts that were referenced by the Ledge Analyst's Office. The first is this chart that comes right out of the Department of Developmental Services.,0.0
False,,"On the severity of people in the service system, both inside the developmental centers and in the community, the discussion point was raised that people in developmental centers have a higher acuity, that they're more difficult, more complex. Actually that's not factually true.",0.0
False,,"If you look at the volume of the people in the community in this chart, when they compare people in developmental centers versus people in the community. There is often tens, hundreds, thousands of people in the community who look just like the people in the developmental centers today and we're serving them every single day in California.",0.0
False,,"They don't need extra treatment in the community, they need appropriate funding. The other chart that I gave you is a chart that shows the number of people that have lived in developmental centers over the past ten years.",0.0
False,,"And, if you look at that, any three year comparison of that chart and the number of people that live in developmental centers, that over a three year period of time, the reduction is greater than the number of people we have left in the Sonoma Developmental Center and the Fairview Developmental Center.",0.0
False,,"Except for one period in there, seven out of eight years, we've been able to move the number of people that live in developmental centers out into the community in every single three year cycle. So when people talk about how hard it is to close a developmental center to move people into the community.",0.0
False,,"We've been doing this for the past eight years. Over any three year cycle you wanna compare, we've moved that many people into the community. This is not hard. We should not make it more difficult than it is. We should do this and we should reinvest in the community just as has been suggested. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. Some of my members pay the existing managed care organization tax. All of my members would pay any new MCO tax, or virtually all of them.",0.0
False,,"So a vested interest in this issue, in past sessions, cap has supported a tax on MediCal managed care plan, that met key principles in any new tax that would go forward would have to meet similar principles including direct benefits to MediCal program, equity among the payers of the tax and consideration of affordability, in the healthcare system.",0.0
False,,"The revised MCO tax was put forth in January by the administration, we felt did not achieve those principles. But to be fair to our partners in the administration, we know we're not here by an act of state policy, it's really a federal policy, that is very prescriptive.",0.0
False,,"That makes it exceedingly difficult to find an alternative funding source that doesn't lead to market dysfunction or huge increases for private payers of care.

False,,"But we already have that for the large production, since, in the last 30 years. And like the author said, this is a unique program and different than a lot of the other tax credit programs because it leverages so much funding at the federal level. So we urge your aye vote, today.",0.0

False,,"California is the leading producer of agriculture in the US, yet many Californians still suffer from hunger and poor nutrition.",0.0
False,,"To help alleviate the state's hunger issues and limit food waste, existing law authorizes farmers to receive a tax credit if they donate their surplus product to a food bank.",0.0
False,,"However, the categories that are included in that are only fresh fruits and vegetables, which leave a lot off the table, such as meat, nuts, dried food, dairy products.",0.0
False,,"So this bill would expand what can be donated to food banks. And it will also adjust things cuz the current tax credit is based on donations of the inventory value of the donation, which can vary greatly between as the values determined for each individual grower and produce and the food to the state.",0.0
False,,"This requires donors to use very, extremely complicated tax code, so we're also streamlining that. And to further stimulate donations, we're also broadening the categories of the eligible food, expanding the tax credit to 15% of the donated wholesale value and to extend the sunset until 2021.",0.0
False,,"I don't know about a lot of you, but I have been out to a lot of food banks. And they could fill their warehouses with unhealthy things, but they really do their best to bring in healthy fruits and vegetables.",0.0
False,,"This, to me, is a way to provide tax credits for the farmers. Even if they donate this food, they still have to do the labor, the water, everything else, so the cost remains the same for them whether they donate it or not.",0.0
False,,So this allows them to be able to donate in a more reasonable way as well as provide more fresh fruits and vegetables to people as well as to expand the kind of food that can be donated.,0.0

False,,"Southern California Edison supports the state's ambitious climate goals and recognizes that, in order to get there in a manner that is consistent with safe, reliable, affordable service to our customers and one that other states and nations can model and achieve. We have to adopt smart policies that focus on the goal in the least cost manner to achieve it. So while Southern California supports the overall goal that AB 645 is attempting to accomplish, we oppose the way in which it sets out to achieve it.",0.0
False,,"AB 645 maintains the structure of the RPS which creates technology winners and losers and maintains inequities within the existing RPS program to the disadvantage of utility customers. The governor's directive in achieving the state's climates goals was to achieve 50% renewables and that's what the policy should do. It should look towards renewables that are in the RPS program as well as other eligible renewable distributed generation.

RPS rules should be applied equitably and equally among all retail sellers.",0.0
False,,"So, as the state moves towards its 2050 GHG emission reduction goals, there are a couple of imperatives. Instead of prescriptive costly mandates, the state must begin to favor least cost options. And we have to put a premium on equitable rules.

There are parts of California that are already experiencing significant shortages of providers for these worthwhile services.",0.0
False,,"This situation will only be exacerbated, we believe by the bill's exemptions and certain of its language. Specifically, we recognized that while there is an exemption, the section 299937(i) related to regional center service providers, there are two points that have to be considered.",0.0
False,,"That exemption speaks specifically to individuals receiving payment from regional centers. But under SB 946, many people receiving insurance provided, behavioral health services, those providers are paid by the insurance companies, not the regional centers.",0.0
False,,"Similarly, as behavioral health is transitioned to over to Medi-Cal, those people will also be paid, not by regional centers, but through Medi-Cal. So an exemption speaks to providers receiving payment from regional centers.",0.0
False,,"That ultimately is going to leave a very small proportion of providers who do behavioral health services. So that's really the concern that we have. Is that ultimately most providers serving our community won't be under this exemption, therefore they will be subject to the licensure requirements.",0.0

False,,"Public schools that were established with the promise, we will give you the freedom to innovate and you will show us results. Charter Schools were established as lighthouses, a place where you could do something a little bit different and perhaps we would learn something that would benefit the entire system of public education.",0.0
False,,"I did attend a meeting of the Louvre Little Hoover commission in Oakland a couple years back and was excited to hear from the director there of Oakland Unified's Charter School Division about a system that he called knowledge transfer, where the principals at charter schools and the principals at traditional public schools would come together and talk about best practices, that's what was intended here, lessons learned.",0.0

False,,"Good afternoon. Madam Chair, members, Rand Martin here on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association Advocates. First I'd, I would like to point out, contrary to your analysis that we do support a statute. There are four laws that would apply to charter schools under this bill.",0.0
False,,"We actually support three of those, Brown Act, Public Records Act, and the Political Reform Act, we would like to see those become law. The sticking point for us is government code 1090, and I do have a witness here who will elaborate on that but it's important to point out the government Code 1090, the problem for us is that it is absolute.",0.0
False,,"It does not allow charter school board members who step up far more frequently than they would often like, I'm sure, to keep charter schools open. 1090 applies to you, it applies to members of the city council, school board trustees and I, you know, not to take any away from, from any of you sitting up there, but I'm not sure that any of you would take a loan second out on your house to help the state of California close any budget deficit.",0.0
False,,"But California, I'm sorry Mr. Wieckowski would, I obviously-",0.0
False,,"I'm not sure your house, well I don't know how valuable your house is.",0.0
False,,"I appreciate that. Charter school board members do step up, take out seconds. Provide low interest, no interest loans to charter schools to keep their doors open. If they are prohibited under government code 1090 from doing that, then it means that that very important access to finances to keep schools open is taken away from us.",0.0
False,,"I also wanna point out that the proponents and even the analysis highlights several horror stories that talk about why this bill is necessary. I ask you, not now obviously, to dig deeper into those horror stories. Two of them are highlighted in the analysis having to do with FCMAT audits.",0.0
False,,"And for those who don't know, FCMAT is a team that comes in from the Department of Education to help a school district and the charter school deal with financial problems. Those were FCMAT audits. They were not abuses, they were not fiscal mismanagement, they were not fraud.",0.0
False,,"And those are the kinds of stories that are being put out there as indications of why this bill is necessary. We want to make clear, that while there are horror stories, all of them so far have been dealt with under current law. And would be dealt with even further under the three sections of the law that we think are important.",0.0
False,,"Sure. And so, a lot of the horror stories that my colleague was referring to speak directly to examples were there has been whether a lease or a loan of money. That has been very problematic. Folks for example, leasing property and then charging twice the market value and then pocketing the extra dollars. So its been a problem.",0.0
False,,"When the bill was in Assembly Education, one thing we heard from the opponents was, this is putting folks in a quandary. Well they have to choose whether they want to give financially, or sit on the governing board, and we would absolutely agree with that.",0.0
False,,"You have to make a choice, you cannot sit on the governing board and have a financial interest in what's going on. You cannot funnel tax dollars into your pocket, and that's the intent of government code 1090, to protect the public. When you do have a financial interest, one quick example, it doesn't necessarily put you on equal footing with the rest of the members of the governing board.",0.0
False,,"So let's say that you are the person whose giving a loan and so now the charter school is dependent on you. You're not an equal vote now with the other members of the governing board, it is very problematic.",0.0
False,,"Senator Wieckowski who has to leave we'll have him ask his question, then we'll go back and continue that conversation.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Madam Chair, just a couple of things. One is, again, back to the horror stories. Yes, you can always highlight a handful of horror stories and say this is ubiquitous. It's not ubiquitous, and where there have been cases, as Mr. Bramble refers to, the law has currently taken care of them.",0.0
False,,"The law, if it's adopted in 709 as we propose, would add certain things, like the Brown Act, where everything would have to happen in transparency, in public, with no secret meetings. Under the Political Reform Act all of the members of the board would have to fill out the same form 700 that you have to fill out, which discloses all of your financial interests. So there's a lot more transparency in those pieces of the bill.",0.0
False,,"I would also point out, and for those of you who sit on non-profit boards of directors it's hard to get people on boards who are willing to commit and work. And if you've got somebody who's willing to commit and work and also provide financial relief to the organization, that's the kind of person you want to be on your board of directors.",0.0
False,,"You don't want them to make that kind of a choice. It really is a Hobson's choice that disadvantages the charter school. We appreciate why you want to do this, but there are other ways of protecting the public's money and we think that the rest of the bill does a dynamite job of doing that.",0.0
False,,"And if we could just take out 1090, we could also possibly get a signature. This is the same bill that Governor Brown vetoed last year. We've been doing this for more than a decade. It's time to bring this debate to an end and do a bill that we can all support.",0.0

False,,"And I probably could say this, maybe the only member in the Assembly or Senate that's actually been under civil service rules. I started with the city of Los Angeles. I know what it's like to take a civil service test. I know what it's like to be on a civil service list.",0.0
False,,"I know what it's like to be picked for a job and not to be picked for a job. I rose to become one of the highest ranking civil service persons in the City of Los Angeles. I know what it's like when the political winds change, and that it was always the civil servants, and it was the individuals that had that civil servant protection,",0.0
False,,"I think ultimately saved, and I can say this now cuz I'm an elected official now, we kinda saved the elected officials from themselves a lot of times. That's the beauty of having a civil service system, we didn't have the corruption that you may have known about in Chicago, New York, Tammany Hall.",0.0
False,,"The whole purpose of having a quality civil service system is so that the public can be assured that everything will be fair and impartial. Saying that but I also was Chair of the mayor's Affirmative Action Task Force, where we worked real hard to ensure that we had equity in every job in the city of Los Angeles.",0.0
False,,"And it is difficult, especially if you have a general manager who is not committed to it, cuz I firmly believe it starts at the top. And if you have a general manager firmly committed to it, even though you may have a mayor or a governor that's committed to it,where the rubber meets the road is in the hiring.",0.0
False,,And the only way you're going to get diversity is that feeling that your best person for the job comes from every ethnic background and that you do not discriminate because of that. You will get the best work force.,0.0
False,,"And I think the city of Los Angeles as it started moving forward with it, started to get some of the best government employees, I think in the country, and I think it was because of that commitment to ensure that you not only pick the best and the brightest, but you understood the diversity and how important it is to the workforce.",0.0

False,,"And hopefully one day we can amend and correct it so that we can ensure that the numbers of the minority majority population don't go down in civil service here in the state of California, but at least meets the levels that it should be, and because of Prop 209 we're gonna have to come up with some creative solutions.",0.0
False,,So I'm here to work with you to come up with some innovative creative ways that we can get there. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"I did just real quick. You're saying that you keep, I'm looking at the data, I see the departments. Do you have this broken, or can you get to the committee, how it's broken down by job occupation? For example, in the city of Los Angeles, if you were to go in the accounting fields, it's heavily dominated by API persons.",0.0
False,,"And for whatever reason, either the place is friendlier, or I don't look at one job as just all people go to one job. Sometimes it's just barriers getting hired in that particular job. Can you get us how African Americans, where are we mostly in? The type of jobs, and things of that nature, and Latinos, and API, disabled, women, where do we fall in as far as job occupation?",0.0

False,,So you can't get it to me?,0.0
False,,"Oh, okay.",0.0

False,, Thank you.,0.0
False,,"I think it goes a little bit more than that. For example, with the UC, right now their enrollment rate of African Americans is at 4%. But they will tell you they spend millions and millions of dollars in recruitment. And they may go to the historically black colleges, or places, to try to get people to come into UC system. But it's not working.",0.0
False,,"And I think it's because of this word called affirmative action. JFK and Executive Order 10, 109, 25, and 61, he ordered the government contractors to take affirmative action to ensure applicants are employed and employees are treated fairly during employment without regard to their race, creed, color or natural origin.",0.0
False,,"It was used to promote actions that achieved non-discrimination. You have to be proactive to get this done. And if you don't put people in place that are proactive to do it, even though you have all the programs, all the outreach, everything is there, but if there's no will to get it done from the top to the people who actually make the employment recommendations. I think that's where we're falling short on.",0.0
False,,"The reason we created affirmative action programs, is because to help those who were not socially conscience or EEO-challenged, get to those numbers in a substantive way.",0.0
False,,"And you working in state government, do you feel that if we were to have more people at the top who had more of an affirmative action, not background but at least were willing to look at it, because in LA. we have things called the rule of three whole scores.",0.0
False,,"And the reason that was put in is because I may have a 91 on a test, I'm sorry, the top person will have a 91, the next person will have a 90, I'll have an 89, that was used to make sure, as an African-American, I was locked out. So Mayor Bradley created the rule of three whole scores so you could go down to that third person, cuz what's the difference between a score of 91, 80, and 89?",0.0
False,,"And so that hopefully increased the number of minorities that were able to get employed in the city of LA. I don't think you have anything like that here. And with Prop 209 you probably couldn't do anything like that, but at least we should have something in place that gives managers an opportunity, who have that notion that we need to get the best qualified, but people with a diverse background.",0.0
False,,"So my question is, you think something like that would be helpful? Because all the programs in the world you can have. But if you don't have the will to do it, it will be very problematic.",0.0
False,,Not me.,0.0
False,,"Okay, you're probably gonna hear me say the AA word a bunch of times today, but affirmative action and just this whole concept of people doing an affirmative approach to having equal opportunity as opposed to laying back and seeing what the rules say. I thank you, President Walker, for telling us about the Fresno program,",0.0
False,,"because you have to do something unique. If you follow the traditional rules and regulations of how to hire, you will never hire. And you have to go out of the box, kind of thinking. But what bothers me in government is we get so attached to the rules that we don't get out of the box, and we don't look at some of the things that you can do.",0.0
False,,"And I want to also thank Secretary Batjer for when I heard about racism in Department of General Services, she got to my office right there. But it should have never gotten to our attention. It should not have risen to a level where a state Senator and Assemblyperson has to get involved. There should be things,",0.0
False,,"but I think just because we're following the rules. And like I tell most people, there's this thing called passive-aggressive racism. And it's passive because they just follow the rules and let things, but it's aggressive racism because the outcomes further debilitate a group even more so.",0.0
True,toxicity,"And I'm not afraid of the, I'll just say it, the Donald Trumps of the world, when they say things that are pretty racist. I'm more afraid of the ones that hide in plain sight.

False,,"Even when I try to pull those individuals out, and general services say, give me names, let's go talk to people they were scared to death about further retaliation, whether it's open or hidden. And so, we've got to find a way to think out of the box on how we can get disadvantaged folk up through the ranks and provide them opportunities.",0.0
False,,"And we can't, we can't become a slave to, we follow step one, two, three, and four. So that tells me I'm no longer a racist anymore. We've got to do more than that.

And it looks like maybe from the Department of Human Resources, Mr. Gillihan. We can't do things traditionally anymore. And are we coming up with out of the box kind of thinking",0.0
False,,"on how to move people up the ladder or bring people in. We had somebody earlier talk about bilingual. I love the Fresno idea, going to the churches? But that's not in any civil service book, okay? And, so you're not gonna find it here. And then, lastly, it is the individual who is in charge of the recruiting. It's individuals in charge of the hiring.",0.0

False,,"I'll get you the link. And just may not be ready for prime time. But what I do know, if I'm going to have the LAO do some research, he may be one of those passive-aggressive people. He's not racist. It's just that he's following the rules that produce the wrong outcome, and I would not have him work on any EEO assignment,",0.0
True,toxicity,"because he either doesn't give a damn, or it's just not in his repertoire to get past that. And I think that's what happens in a lot of government positions, that you have people that are just kind of following along, making sure they don't step out of line and not willing to take the risk to ensure that we have a diverse work group.

False,,It seems this is an issue that the Board of Supervisors has every opportunity to engage in a setting of a policy if they so felt that was necessary.

False,,"We've had the same 30% cost of living, cost of providing services during that time period and we have absolutely no capacity to make that money up because you guys control whether we get the increase or not.

False,,"We do appreciate that, at least this year, Senator Leno and others have worked on trying to open a door through the special session to raise this issue. There's been committees established on each side that have our name as part of that, but we literally have no capacity whatsoever to absorb this cost unless you fund us.",0.0
False,,"So we would ask consideration that this bill be amended to factor in those costs. In other words, a state mandate on programs that are doing the work the state is mandating us to do. If you don't do that, you're basically destining us to go out of business and we're talking 56-year-old agencies. They're working in every one of your communities.",0.0
False,,"The last call you're gonna wanna get is from an agency that says I've got 71 families who now cannot find a program for their person, their child, so they can go to work during the day, but that's exactly what's gonna happen if you pile on the factor of not giving increases to this community and then further exacerbating it by saying, by the way, you also have to increase the amount you pay to your workers.",0.0
False,,"We don't have the capacity to do that. So we're in a oppose unless amended category. We simply ask that you recognize the impact that you're putting on our agencies by requiring this. You can fix it. You can fix it readily, just by simply putting the money in that goes along with that.",0.0
False,,"And at least that doesn't add further injury to the insult we've suffered by not getting a rate increase in this year's budget. If that were done, we could at least feel good about this and raising our lower end workers pay. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Thurmond, appreciate the question. We'll certainly work on that with Senator Leno, yourself and others to, get at that. Again, there's three major issues for us. One is just the impact of the minimum wage being brought up so that impacts our lower level, typically entry level workers as I know you are aware because of your work in the industry.",0.0
False,,"Yeah. Secondly, is what we call compaction, which is the issue when you have people that have been there much longer than an entry-level worker and all of a sudden the bottom end creeps up so close that they get to where their experience is no longer valued. You can't really pay for it because there's not the funding for it.",0.0
False,,"And they start look elsewhere at other positions and will leave or have extreme dissatisfaction and the third issue is the exempt problem where staff, by law, have to be paid double in order to avoid overtime and other rules. Typically supervisorial positions, those aren't covered and we can try to figure out what those numbers look like.",0.0
False,,"The rate increases that you're talking about in special session would potentially help a great deal as well, but, we really don't have a choice but to oppose unless amended, to accommodate this and I do want to say that in past, in state budget, we have done minimum wage increase recognition's to put money into the state budget as minimum wage was drug up. We have done that legislatively, in the history of this legislature on a number of times.",0.0

False,,"That you see a direct drag when prices have to go up that much, they handle a 63% increase in the labor. So I think you're seeing from this community an argument that, shoot we can't cover our wages and the state's not providing the support to cover this size of an increase and you're hearing, I think from us an inability or fear that there's an inability to recapture through price, the increase that's coming.",0.0
False,,I'll try and gather information on your community generally. I don't know about that. I think statewide.,0.0

False,,"I did. It's sort of, we view it as the starting point and the entry point and with that wage comes training on how to show up on time and how to be a good employee and how to work with your coworkers and all those things that go into these jobs. Our fear is as the entry point gets higher, the ability to provide those opportunities go down, one.",0.0

False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans in opposition to the bill. Let me start off by saying that from our perspective SB 546 is not a simple transparency bill. The bill required my members to sell their large purchaser rates to the government, for the purpose of a specific regulatory action.",0.0
False,,"Mainly, the determination of whether the rate, that both parties agreed to is reasonable. This premise is fundamentally flawed. The bill sets up a system by which two relatively large and sophisticated market actors can shake hands, sign a contract and then have the government come in and and characterize that agreement.",0.0
False,,"This makes no sense in a large employer market which is why most employers are not asking for this bill and indeed, Calpers is trying to carve itself out of the bill as well.

False,,"Employers dictate many of the terms, sometimes they want to pay more for more services. The market is also primarily experience rated and what this means is that the projected cost for an insurance policy is based on the claims history of the party seeking to be insured, so the claims history of the employees.",0.0
False,,"It's also important to keep in mind that Health Plans in the large-group market must meet a medical loss ratio of 80%. This means that 80% of every premium dollar has to be spent on direct medical services. In essence, if there is a rate increase offered to a large purchaser, that rate is reflective of the underlying cost of care and services.",0.0
False,,"Sometimes rates will go up and sometimes they will go down and indeed we know and we've heard from some of the supporters of this bill that they rates have gone down in recent years in certain areas. If the purchaser doesn't like the rate they're getting from the insurance company, it can shop that rate in the market and find a different plan under guarantee issue.",0.0
False,,"There is nothing tying a purchaser to a particular plan. This bill will only succeed in increasing costs in the healthcare system.

So for those reasons we are opposed. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Thank you assemblymember. Not to hit the rewind button but I do want to bring SB 1182 back into the conversation. For experience rated groups, which is primarily the way rates are constructed in the large group market, any rate changes are determined almost exclusively using the claims history of the group.",0.0
False,,"So the previous years' utilization in consumption of care and under 1182, the group gets claims data that's pretty sophisticated and goes all the way down.

You know, we haven't got a complete picture of what exactly the data is that's missing, that they need.",0.0
False,,"If that's the conversation, that's a completely different thing than requiring the government to put a stamp, or scarlet letter I should say, on a health plan rate with a large purchaser that's already been agreed to by both sides.

False,,We're opposed to that too.,0.0

False,,That target should only be established through a regulatory proceeding with the full benefit of economic analysis and stakeholder input. And for these reason we are opposed. Thank you. And we also agree with the comments made earlier.,0.0
False,,"Mister Chairman and members. Cindy Howell with Southern California Edison. All IOUs, Southern California Edison included have the same objective as policy makers and that is safe, reliable, affordable energy, service and delivery. We need to make sure that any rules, regulations, and actions align with these interest and don't create cross incentives that hinder reaching those objectives. SCE is opposed to AB 1266 as unnecessary, duplicative, and not workable.",0.0
False,,It duplicates existing public processes related to executive compensation. And ignores total compensation as benchmarked against relevant market to ensure that we target market level compensation to ensure we attract and retain qualified employees in all categories. And this extends to the leadership team. AB 1266 ignores due process implications to the extent that there is no requirement for any finding of culpability before a process is triggered to retroactively claw back compensation.,0.0
False,,If there is a need for additional rules and regulations to hold officers accountable for decisions this is a questionable way to go about it. The CPUC currently has open investigations and takes actions to the extent of believes there is mismanagement. Routinely the CPUC can and does disallow recovery of costs or does not allow including costs in rates to the extent they find that there's been a reason to do so. And this bill also ignores that a significant portion of executive compensation is disallowed.,0.0
False,,"Currently our shareholders invest in the system, the money is advanced by shareholders and then it is only recovered to the extent the CPUC allows it to be recovered, and for these reasons Southern California Edison is opposed, thank you.",0.0

False,,"There was no subpoena for Southern California Edison to appear at any hearing in Washington D.C., we respectfully declined an invitation by the committee. There was no fifth amendment right that was invoked. Second, Southern California Edison is going through a tremendous transition.",0.0
False,,"As all of you know, there's tremendous transition in this industry. And we are forced to make very, very difficult decisions in order to make sure that the utility that employs 13,000 hard working individuals in Southern California, and has been around for over 128 years, can continue to be around for the next 100 years.",0.0
False,,"So we're making these tough decisions, none of it's easy. And the employees that were laid off were not asked to train their replacements. We have contracted with managed service companies with a skilled workforce.",0.0
False,,"There are, however, Edison-specific processes and software that needed to be communicated. So with that, I'd like to go into our opposition of 853, which sets a very, very challenging policy for utilities to implement in that anytime we would contract out for work, we would be required to go through a public process of the CPUC and get a written decision to do so.",0.0
False,,"We have thousands of contract workers, a lot of those are union jobs. A lot of them are with diverse businesses that is in support of policies adopted by this Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission. We have over 700 contracts with diverse businesses throughout our service territory, and throughout a range of roles, and with a range of responsibilities.",0.0
False,,"All those contracts would have to go through this process. These processes, these hearings and decisions, can take months, if not years, to go through. So with regard to our opposition to the bill, again, my earlier statement, I think utility is on the same page with policymakers.",0.0
False,,"I mean, our interests are safe, reliable, affordable and quite frankly, to the extent there are barriers created as 853 does, and our ability to use contract workers to accomplish that work, it jeopardizes that. So, I think with that I would just ask for your no vote.  Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Tamara Rasberry on behalf of the Sempra Utilities, San Diego Gas and Electric, and the Southern California Gas Company, also in support of this bill.",0.0
False,,"We talked earlier this morning, or today about energy efficiency goals and targets.",0.0
False,,And we really can't achieve those goals and targets set up before us by the legislature and the governor without removing the barriers to existing conditions.,0.0

False,," Good afternoon, Mr. Chair and members. Connie Delgado with the California Hospital Association here in opposition. I want to state first that we do support the full practice authority for many of these healthcare professionals we've worked with several other members of this committee on other pieces of legislation. However, the amendments that were taken on May 28th, to insert the corporate practice of medicine and imply those provisions.",0.0
False,,"That ban to other healthcare professionals is very problematic for hospital members. That ban creates an additional layer of obstacles that we see for providing healthcare services to those communities, rural, low-income, communities of color. Where getting healthcare professionals are problematic. Where having physicians in those communities is already a challenge. So to place an additional layer of burden, and not allow for hospitals to employ these professionals, really creates a problem. This bill does expand and removes the physician oversight requirement. And thus creates the opportunity for these practitioners to work in our facilities, but with the corporate practice language in the bill that does create a very big problem. And for us we are not able to support this bill today. And I have additional. Person here to answer any technical questions you may have.",0.0

False,,"How do you do that? You don't do it by creating a new administration for a program that then takes $100 million of rate payer money and redistributes it. You do it by reforming the current program. You do it by removing market barriers, as my colleague stated before.",0.0
False,,You do it by allowing incentives to go to low income communities with older facilities and older homes that are below code and you also do it by reforming the current retrospective process that is used to verify energy efficiency savings incentive programs that are administrated by the utilities.,0.0
False,,"You don't do it by creating another layer of bureaucracy, another layer of administration to say that the utilities aren't doing this job, so we're gonna do it for them. We don't think that will give you savings, and for those reasons we oppose this bill. Thank you.",0.0
False,," Thank you, Chair and members. Nick Pappas with Southern California Edison. We are also opposed to this bill. I think I'd like to echo the proponents' comments. We totally agree that energy efficiency is a vital tool as we move forward in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the electric sector.",0.0
False,,"We also think market transformation can play a role there. That's why we're currently, actively participating in the CPUC proceeding on market transformation and other energy efficiency issues to try to address some of the barriers and issues as some of my other utility colleagues mentioned, so that we can more effectively pursue market transformation, which currently the structure really does not assist utilities in pursuing these long term pathways instead of incentivizing us to using more shorter term incentive programs.",0.0
False,,"So among other barriers we're looking at that in trying to fix that in the ongoing proceeding. Another big question in the proceeding is whether market transformation should be handled by utilities or should be handled by a third party. I would note that the only CPUC document that I'm aware of on this topic was a staff report which specifically declined recommending market transformation be sourced out to a third party, and said we should wait to see what the stakeholder discussion is in the CPUC proceeding on this specific topic.",0.0
False,,"Finally, I'll just note the comment from the author that the CPUC would like to have the authority to, essentially, outsource from utilities to a third party this market transformation issue. I would just note that it's a very different policy discussion whether we give authority to the Public Utilities Commission to do this.",0.0
False,,"This bill take a very different approach, which is mandating that the Public Utilities Commission make a pretty significant policy change, which is consolidating market transformation to a third party. So, with those issues notated, we respectfully ask for your no vote. Thank you.",0.0

False,,And so this legislation would set that up.,0.0
False,,"We have a strong framework here, in Senate bill 614, for the certification of peer support specialists, as required by the Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to obtain federal reimbursement.",0.0

False,,The certification of this profession offers a number of important benefits.,0.0
False,,It establishes a standard scope of practice and also a code of ethics. It offers a professional voice for peers. And it allows us to obtain federal reimbursement. It also allows for the portability of peers from one county or one program to another.,0.0
False,,"Given California's renewed interest in developing a robust healthcare workforce to meet the diversity and the needs of our residents, we feel that the peer certification program goes a long way toward reaching that goal.",0.0

False,,"Thank you very much for the question. Adrian Shelton, CBHDA.",0.0
False,,"So we are going to be able to obtain at least a 50% federal match for the services that are provided, assuming this bill gets passed.",0.0

False,,"And I also would add that the counties and community-based agencies are training peers now and paying for those trainings, but are not able to obtain the 50% federal match for those services, so there are funds now that are Mental Health Services Act funds, there are realignment funds available at the local level for these trainings for this purpose.",0.0

False,,"Good morning, Mister Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Stone and members. I'd like to first start by accepting the amendments that are outlined on page seven of the analysis. These amendments serve to clarify that the bill does not apply to cities or other buildings which share the name of the city in which they are situated. And to they clarify that the bill only applies to names of elected leaders and senior military officers of the Confederacy.",0.0

I have copies for the members of the committee. Our public building should be named for people of great accomplishment who are role models of high morals and principals.",0.0
False,,Unfortunately some public places in California still honor Confederate leaders who attempted to break America in two to protect their right to enslave people. I don't want to erase their names from our history books. I just don't want our children looking up to people who fought to preserve a system that treated human beings as cattle.,0.0
False,,"This is the basis for my legislation SB 539, the Frederick Douglass Liberty Act, which seeks to remove the names of elected and military leaders of the Confederacy from all public places including parks, buildings, roadways and schools. Frederick Douglas was an escaped slave who became a truly historic figure in his activism against slavery. The murders of nine black churchgoers in South Carolina a few weeks ago stunned all of us.",0.0

False,,"My legislation is not an answer to systemic racism that does permeate American society in far too many places. It does nothing to fund programs to improve racial tolerance and understanding. It simply shines a light on some overlooked examples here in California of where we are celebrating traitorous leaders even those who lead what would be considered honorable lives before or after the Civil War. I'm pleased to have with me the Mayor of Pittsburgh, Pete Longmire who would like to say a few words in support of the bill.",0.0
False,,"That's a good question and certainly share your philosophical views about local control. And I guess I would say this, we've given them, what, 50, 60, 70 years to work on that and yet, we still see these examples in our state. So I think we've given them that opportunity to do the right thing locally. And I do support that as a fundamental goal. But in this case it hasn't happened. So I think that a little nudge from us is probably what's necessary to deal with the remainders of these examples, these poor examples that we do see in our state.",0.0
False,,"Assemblyman, I think that you could probably look to many people who have committed great horrors in the world. And find some examples where you might say they were a good family man. They took care of their staff in a kind way. They were generous to charity. And so, in each of these cases I think we have to understand the magnitude of what we're analyzing and examining.",0.0

The ability of states to enslave people against their will, and I think at that level, and given the actual effects of that conflict, 650,000 Americans killed?

Now we're talking about when you walk into a school and you look up and you see who is on the marquee, who you're going to honor, who you're going to put in a place of respect in our state.

False,,"So the legislation needs to provide some direction and some analysis to determine the best path forward and not simply continue on with the same program, because it's more difficult and it's more costly, it's really important that we look at this on the impact of the state's economy because the stakes are high.",0.0
False,,"A positive and necessary first step is to work with the regulated entities to figure this path out. We believe the path starts with a well designed cap and trade program. That provides the bulk of emission reductions and unfortunately as the committee analysis points out on SB 32, it's just silent on the use of cap and trade to the extent it needs to be.",0.0

False,,"Just briefly, Madam Chair and members, again this bill is focused on notification that a contract has been entered into for the sale of a story of a crime. And importantly, first and foremost, this is about allowing a victim to be aware that something may be put out in the media in some form or fashion.",0.0
False,,"So that a victim and their family can prepare to see their story perhaps portrayed in some fashion. And so that's first and foremost what this is about. Secondarily, as part of current law, the Son of Sam law provides a ten-year window for victims to pursue civil damages through the civil code of procedure to seek damages associated with the sale of such stories.",0.0
False,,"While that is going to remain at a ten year mark, the challenge is, is that victims in most cases aren't aware that a contract has even been entered into. Such that they even could pursue that option that's already current law. So that is secondary to the initial part about preparing themselves.",0.0
False,,"But nonetheless, if a victim doesn't know that a contract exists, how can they utilize that process? In terms of the actual component of the contract, and any ability to veto that, this bill gives no right to the victim to interfere with that contract, and being entered into, from that story being told. So to be clear, there is no provision in this bill that does that.",0.0
False,,"And there have been some questions and concerns raised around the first amendment. We do believe this bill has been narrowly crafted to meet the intermediate scrutiny of requirement. Such that it meets on the state's interest as part of enforcing and upholding proposition nine, which is the victim's bill of rights, the Marcy Law.",0.0
False,,Which provided for victims to be made whole. And be entitled to and receive restitution for the crimes committed against them. So for those reasons we feel that this again was very narrowly crafted. And we'd also like to support the comments made in the analysis. Which is a very thorough and appreciative analysis about the concerns of the media folks who would feel like this is a chilling of free speech.,0.0
False,,"To the extent that they would have to do such notification, the notification is merely a simple FYI. A contract has been entered into. The bill requires nothing more than that, such that the media entity wouldn't even have to Indicate who they are. Such that the victim, if you feel compelled and want to pursue that civil code process to seek damages, they would have to then in and of themselves hire legal counsel to pursue that route.  So for those reasons we strongly support and believe this is narrowly tailored, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Understood Madam Chair, thank you. So with regard to the Son of Sam lot, specifically, about a criminal not profiting from the sale of their crime. So from our vantage point to the extent that there are resources exchanged, that's important for the purpose of this bill.",0.0
False,,"To the extent that it has an effect on chilling of speech, we would argue that because no details are required to be divulged as part of this, just mere notification, it would be incumbent upon the victim to actually pursue further detail in finding out if there is a path forward in terms of seeking damages.",0.0
False,,"So although they're related in terms of overarching principle around a criminal not profiting from their crime, at the same time we want that process on the civil side to be able to play out to the extent that a victim even chooses to move forward with that.

False,,"A large portion of this debt will likely never be repaid back, as many ex-offenders are of lower socioeconomic status, which hurts them, hurts their families, and the state of California. This pronounced indebtedness not only feeds recidivism but puts an additional strain of both parent-child and parent-parent relationships.",0.0
False,,"In 2010, this legislature passed a law to allow for the freezing of child support orders for incarcerated parents if they had no income. The original intent of the law was for incarcerated parents to request this option through the court system or administratively through the Department of Child Support Services.",0.0
False,,"AB 610 extends this existing law to permit a parent who is incarcerated with no income, to freeze their child support order only if, both, I repeat, both parents have no reservations. The child support agency must alert the custodial parent before making any administrative modifications, and manage the subsequent court case if there is a concern.",0.0
False,,"This bill will also hold DCSS accountable by tasking them to assess the effectiveness of the administrative adjustment process and report back to this legislature. AB 610 will help curtail the problem of uncollectible and unmanageable debt held by formally incarcerated parents, which inevitably makes reentry even more challenging.",0.0
False,,"Moreover, extension of current law through this bill will also help reduce financial penalties imposed on California by the federal government for our state's accumulation of uncollected child support debt. Here today to testify is Karen Lange, legislative advocate for Placer, San Joaquin,",0.0
False,,"Stanislaus counties, and Tammy Owner, Placer county Deputy Director of Child Support. Thank you and I humbly ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Yes, I am.",0.0
False,,Yes. I would respectfully ask for an aye vote.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chairman, Member Chiu, I was not here when you introduced your bill initially. I'm happy to support it today.",0.0
False,,"And if there's the opportunity down the line to act for the co-authors, I'd be pleased to join with you in this important effort.",0.0
False,,"Thank you. I'm supportive of the Chair's recommendation, but I did have a question. In the event that there is not agreement between the parties, will this be able to come back to this committee for review, or does it simply continue on and it goes to the floor, and we bypass this committee on that dispute?",0.0
False,,"Yeah, but it seems to me, though, that if the dispute continues and it is unresolved that supporting this recommendation today means there's no chance except on the floor to come up with a different view.",0.0
False,,"So, but if the author doesn't see to any changes, to the 10% recommendation along the process, it will not come back before this committee. So if these negotiations break down, which I know we don't want to see happen.",0.0
False,,"If they do break down, it means that this bill with that recommendation is going to be going to the floor.",0.0
False,,So that committee will have lost its opportunity as a committee to cast judgement about that 10% with the exception of what we're doing today. And that's my concern about it.,0.0
False,,"Good morning. I'm Victoria Rome with the Natural Resources Defense Council, also in support. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, I'm Victoria Rome with the Natural Resources Defense Council, here in support of the bill. Just very briefly, we see this as a reasonable and appropriate response to the recent oil spill off the Santa Barbara coast.",0.0
False,,"It requires pipeline operators to use best available technology, including leak detection and automatic shut off valves to minimize oil spill impacts. The recent oil leak was not detected right away, leaving oil to leak for several hours, fouling the coastline and harming wildlife.",0.0
False,,"And we feel that this bill would help address future leaks more expeditiously, so that we can protect these valuable resources. Thank you.",0.0
False,,I'll let Mr. Lee finish. I know you've been waiting patiently.,0.0
False,,"I also wanna thank all the members of Business and Professions Committee and also Jobs Economic Development and the Economy Committee and especially the chairs, Chair Bonita and Chair Garcia for the Black Caucus.",0.0
False,,There's kind of a method to our madness for why we're bringing all these groups together.,0.0
False,,"Because once we get to a point, cause this is with data collection, gathering information, but once we get to a point where we need to start pushing forth policy, the members that are here, and I'm so glad that you're here to hear this, the members who are here are votes that we need to be able to push forth our agenda.",0.0
False,,"And so we do have, we're real strategic in what we do.",0.0
False,,"But most important I think it's good for you as members of the legislature to hear from a community that you may not always get a chance to hear from, especially on something like this as black enterprise.",0.0
False,,"Whenever the Black Caucus has a discussion about education, which is our number one priority, I will tell you, it is our Chair of Black Business Committee, COBC, it's Cheryl Brown that always pipes up and says, yeah that's right, but, what about business?",0.0
False,,"And, if it wasn't for her, we wouldn't be staying on task.",0.0
False,,"And I will say, not only with the California Legislature Black Caucus, but when we were in the Democratic caucus meetings, she will speak up for business in a heartbeat.",0.0
False,,"And I'm glad we finally got here, that we were able to have discussion.",0.0
False,,And my question is more of an observation and also kind of moving forward.,0.0
True,toxicity,"For me, someone that kind of went through the drug area when we had crack cocaine and we just lost our mind and we started locking everybody up like mad, mostly African Americans.",0.18917519
False,,One of the things that was always interesting to me is that we had a lot of young African American males that went into that business.,0.0
False,,"And it is a business. And they started at the local level and it went city wide, sometimes they went state wide, some went national. But they had no formal education, some of them didn't even finish high school.",0.0
False,,"But they knew marketing, accounts receivable, payable, they kept inventory in their head, they were some of the most astute businessmen I ever knew, and they all, many of them, ended up in our prison system.",0.0
False,,"We've probably lost a generation of some really great entrepreneurs, who if they had had the right direction, the right resources, they could have quit Harvard like the person that started Facebook.",0.0
False,,"They could have quit a lot of the institutions they're not going into. They could have started a computer system in their parents' garage, and created Microsoft.",0.0
False,,"They could have done all of that if they had had the right direction and a place to go. And so my question really is, and what I'm really concerned about, is how do we start to create, because we're talking about jobs, and we keep talking about jobs from established businesses that aren't majority African American.",0.0
False,,"When do we start grabbing those young entrepreneurs, and redirect them, either in junior high school, elementary school, and redirect them to start their own businesses, so they can hire other African Americans, and so that we can create our own wealth, so they can learn what wealth is.",0.0
False,,"Because part of that number you see in wealth is not only owning your home, but owning a business, and this may be a question for everybody that comes up, but where do you see where we can start building that kind of infrastructure for the black community.",0.0
False,,Just very briefly and thank you Chairman very much for coming. I'm Susan Eggman. I represent the city of Stockton in the area so.,0.0
False,,"One of the things that I think would be helpful, especially since some of us are going to be around here a little while, is to just have more coordination and interaction with members.",0.0
False,,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I know my district pretty well. And I just met with someone from the strategic growth counsel about some of the money they're putting out. And they said, oh we had a meeting in Stockton last week and I'm like, well who'd you talk to and why don't I know about it?",0.0
False,,"Right, because I think, and that's an easy policy fix we can do that with contrast that come, programs that were, that there should be some coordination I think with members' offices and then we can help.",0.0
False,,Because if you ask me which organizations in my community can get the word out and which ones take money and don't.,0.0
False,,There's a lot of back story that we all know that goes on in communities. So I just think for all of our to think about. If we could be a little bit more helpful in coordinating how information goes out as we're going to be here a little bit longer.,0.0
False,,"Okay, I need you to wrap up.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Ms. Bridges, and we're gonna have the Chair of Business Professions committee who just joined us. Ms. Bonilla, if you would like to say a few words.",0.0
False,,"I want to thank Ms. Bonilla for being here and before you got here, because we all were going back. In fact, I was late getting here and if I were to sum up, there was like two or three points that were made about impediments for black businesses to succeed here in California.",0.0
False,,"One that almost every panel said, was access to capital and an inability for African-Americans to try to get start up money. Whether it's the SBA, where most small businesses are $150,000 but SBA's number's at $450,000 for them to even start.",0.0
False,,"The other is education of course and being able to educate the work force so they can be there. And as Mister Gibson, who is here, earlier said, the big elephant in the room is Proposition 209. Which many of us believe has been a beacon to stop women, minorities, and others from actually getting into, not only the workforce, being able to start their businesses.",0.0
False,,"And so, as we start looking at contracting with the state for example, getting those numbers up because a lot of businesses, that's how they get their startup. Either through government and then hopefully they can expand and then start from, and become a prime one day.",0.0
False,,"And be able to take on larger contracts and so we lost a lot of our members. But just about every member on all three committees showed up. And it's really great because wherever we move forward with, we need your committee.",0.0
False,,"we need Mr. Eduardo Garcia's committee to be able to move things forward, and it looks like we probably need to add another committee called Banking and Finance to flush out even that trounce of it. But if Mrs. Weber you want to say a few words?",0.0
False,,"Okay. And most of the people who probably had a lot of questions probably are trying to get their bills through committee. And so I wanna thank you for coming, but",0.0
False,,"I'm waiting to see how many people show up, whether or not it's one minute or two minutes.",0.0
False,,Two minutes.,0.0
False,,"We sure will, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Is there any other public comment? Well, I wanna thank everyone for coming out. We're about 20 minutes past our time and we're about 22 minutes past our time. Come on, come on up.",0.0
False,,"All right, thank you. One of the thing we're gonna have to, and I think I'm gonna follow up and I think Ms. Brown who's the Chair of this Committee is gonna follow up on. There was some interesting things that were said by Mr. Lacey and Mr. Burnett, who are African-American entrepreneurs.",0.0
False,,"We've been trying to do this from government on down or we talk to employees on up. But we never talk to the people employing people. And I think I will follow, I definitely will follow-up with the people who own the Burger King, and the Fat Burger, and the Buffalo Wild Wings franchise.",0.0
False,,"Because they say they do hire at-risk youth and people. And so what is it that you say to them? When you look them eye-to-eye, what's in you that says, you know what, I'm gonna take that risk, and I'm gonna go. And then when it fails, you don't give up.",0.0
False,,"What is it that makes you come back again and again? Cuz that's what we're finding whether it's housing, the formerly incarcerated. We have people that don't even wanna allow them to live in their place, even though they may have a great job and been working on it for a couple of years.",0.0
False,,"Once you're incarcerated, which is a lot of African-American males, for example, how do we get re-acclimated if no one will give them a job and no one will house them? And I think it takes a special kind of individual that can look someone in the eye and know deep down that if you just gave them a chance, they can make it.",0.0
False,,"And so we're gonna have to figure that out. Not only for ourselves, but for other businesses to teach them how to bring those individuals back into society. And I personally wanna thank you the California Legislative Black Caucus. Dr. Weber and I thank you, thank everyone for coming out.",0.0
False,,"This is just the beginning, this is the first step, probably the first hearing we've had in quite some time on African-American businesses. We'll take this information and maybe hopefully we can pose some kind of white paper what went on here, and then talk with some of the presenters about the next steps so that we can get to policies and some budget items.",0.0
False,,"But also how do we talk to the private sector to work with them to make things better. So again I thank you on behalf of the California Legislative Black Caucus and our Chair of the Business Summit, Cheryl Brown. Meeting stands.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Seth Bramble here on behalf of California Teachers Association, proud to co-sponsor this important legislation. As this bill has moved through the legislative process we heard an assertion from the California Charter School's Association that the authorizer approves admission requirements and preferences and would reject things that were inappropriate.",0.0
False,,"We have found widespread that not to be true, that there's a number of discriminatory admission requirements and preferences that we've seen in the state, and some of those examples were outlined by the Senator here.",0.0
False,,"One, in terms of requiring volunteer hours, public advocates put out a piece of research earlier this year where they looked at 500 schools, we're not talking about a school or two, and a third of those schools did have mandatory volunteer hour requirements.",0.0
False,,"Now that may not be a problem if you have two parents at home and one is available to provide time to volunteer in a school. But in a situation where, for example Grandma is acting as Mom and Dad and working two jobs, when they see the application that has a volunteer requirement they set that application to the side. It's a deterrent even seeing an application that has a requirement for volunteer hours.",0.0
False,,"One specific example at Santiago Charter School authorized by Orange Unified School District, there's a requirement of 12 service hours that parents are asked to state where they're going to volunteer that time. Or actually, they fill out a form here, or will they donate money, quote, ""for every $10 donated, you will receive one service hour credit"".",0.0
False,,"That's an example of the kind of discriminatory admission requirements and preferences we seek to eliminate. In some cases, some California charter schools had up to 30, 40 hours of required volunteer hour requirements per year for parents.",0.0
False,,"I did pass out a number of examples to you members of the committee regarding some of these discriminatory admission requirements and preferences. Those were the result of kind of a quick Google search, so those are probably not the most problematic examples, those that maybe weren't posted online and that we don't know about.",0.0
False,,These kinds of preferences in admission criteria become an increasingly creative discriminatory and limit student access at charter schools. Charter schools are public schools that must be available to all students. We urge your aye vote.,0.0
False,,Make room for me. Always make room for me.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association, first I want to make clear, we're not here to talk about the preferences piece, or the volunteer hours piece, we're comfortable with that language in the bill.",0.0
False,,"We're only here to talk about the discipline piece. In 1992 when the Charter Schools Act was enacted, one of the essential precepts of the law was that charter schools would be subject to a megawaiver of great swafs of code relative to the pedagogy, the delivery of instruction, the operation.",0.0
False,,"Ever since that time, in the ensuing 23 years, when there has been a problem that has been validated, we have all stepped forward and fixed it in the law to make sure that the problem did not continue. What we are lacking in this bill, unfortunately, is a demonstration of a problem.",0.0
False,,"First, I need to make it very clear that despite some of the assertions by Senator Leno, as well as the sponsors, we are governed under the law currently relative to due process. We must abide by due process and we do.",0.0
False,,"We also must abide by a discipline policy that includes expulsion and suspension that is vetted by our authorizer, approved by our authorizer, overseen by our authorizer and if our authorizer finds that there's a problem, the authorizer has the authority to step in and either cure the situation or if it's awful enough to lead to the revocation of the charter school.",0.0
False,,"We have a pretty heavy sword hanging over our heads to make sure that we do the right thing and that we comply with the discipline policy that we agreed to. The author also has mentioned reports out of US Department of Education and US Department of Justice which, on the surface, sound like they are validation of a problem in California, but they're not.",0.0
False,,California charter schools have not demonstrated a problem in terms of suspending or expelling students at any greater rate than traditional public schools.,0.0
False,,"And in fact, in the data that we're more easily able to get access to, which is the suspension data, we actually suspend at lower rates across all grade levels and across all demographic groups. I wish I could say the same for expulsion. The expulsion data is unfortunately heavily redacted, very difficult to get to, so it's harder to make that assertion.",0.0
False,,"But we believe the suspension is probably a really good indication that that's the situation with expulsion as well. We have faced a lot of bills this year, last session, previous sessions, where we seek to re-regulate charter schools. If you're going to re-regulate us, demonstrate that there's a problem.",0.0
False,,"Please demonstrate that there's a problem before we actually make these changes, because these changes have heavy-duty costs. Both in terms of actually implementation and actual cost to us without a justification. We urge you to vote no. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Thurmond. In answer to your first question about the expenses and the cost, for those who don't know, who may be new to the Legislature this year, charter schools are not covered by the mandate reimbursement process in California law.",0.0
False,,"There was a mandate block grant adopted in the budget a couple years ago. Everything that was a mandate at that point, we do get some reimbursement for. But every mandate that's adopted statutorily subsequent to that, and this would be a mandate, we would have to pay for.",0.0
False,,"And if you look through the process that's enumerated in the bill, there are a lot of steps that we have to go through that we know that traditional school districts have to as well, but they get paid for it. So the hearing process, the subpoena serving, fees and mileage that have to be paid, perhaps finding an alternative program for the kid while the expulsion process is happening, would be an expense to us.",0.0
False,,"So all those things would add up and you magnify that by the fact that the bill applies not to just what we all view as traditional expulsions, but also wherever a kid is leaving involuntarily from the charter school for something that has nothing to do with an expellable offense, but is still a reason for the kid to leave.",0.0
False,,"That would still, the process would be implemented exactly like the process would be if a kid had brandished a firearm on campus. So, those are the costs. In answer to your second question, the answer is myriad, because every charter school is going to deal with things differently.",0.0
False,,You heard Mr. Paz from APEX Academy talk about how many kids actually do come back to APEX. And that they pride themselves on the fact that one of the things that they do is deal with those really hard cases. And many of them do end up coming back.,0.0
False,,"Many kids who leave who end up being expelled from a charter school. the charter school works with a school district to find a placement for that kid because the school district has more options available to it. One of the things that bothers us about the implementation of this bill, is we would have no place to put that kid in most cases,",0.0
False,,"because charter schools are just not big enough to have the range of alternative or options, for a kid who is expelled like a continuation school, like an independent study program. So those are some examples. With time I could probably give you many pages of examples of what happens to a kid. But everything is done to try to make sure a kid is put into an appropriate program.",0.0
False,,"Okay, well that's... It is lower. I can tell you that what you get back is much lower.",0.0
False,,"Okay, well that's news to me.",0.0
False,,"I think it's always fair to say that there are work-arounds. We don't necessarily like laws that create situations where we have to find work-arounds, but we're talking about that period of time that could be up to 80 days",0.0
False,,"under the process in this bill, where we would have to find an alternative educational program for that kid. Yeah, it may be that we can work out something with the district during that 80 days. But that's not always gonna be the case and it may not even be the case in the majority of situations. We'd be responsible in most cases to make sure that, that kid was getting alternative programming.",0.0
False,,"Thank you. Senators, Robert Gore from the Gualco Group on behalf of the business labor, and public members of the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance founded by Pat Brown.",0.0
False,,"We're in strong support. We feel Ms. Lee is exceptionally well-qualified, in particular, commend her for her extensive work with CAPCOA and local authorities. She'll do very well.",0.0
False,,"Mr Chair, members, Barry Nelson on behalf of the American Federation of State County Municipal Employees. Just wanted to quickly add that the legislature over 18 years ago stepped in and told the university to have the four classifications. That temporary workers was unacceptable in this body helped to address the issue by making these workers full time.",0.0
False,,"So, unfortunately, we're in a place right now where we're still witnessing subcontracted job as evidenced by the testimony from President Livarger. We're asking the UC as a valued and leading institution an education to ensure that they can do better for their employees and taxpayers in the state of California. We're asking for due diligence, transparency, and accountability. Asking for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,Thank you Chairman Salas. And first I'd like to extend regrets from Director Mark Ghilarducci. You had invited to participate today. Unfortunately he had another commitment in southern California that he had to attend to today.,0.0
False,,So myself and Mr. Rabamad will be here representing Director Gillerduchie today. But he definitely is very passionate about directing our statewide emergency response as the Chair of the Governor's Drought Task Force. And wished he could be here today.,0.0
False,,My name is Eric Lamoureux. I am a regional administrator for the CalOES Inland region. CalOES is divided into thirds operationally.,0.0

False,,Our coastal region goes from Del Norte County down to Monterey County.,0.0
False,,"And then our Southern region, are our southern california counties, and then up the eastern Sierras to Mono County.",0.0
False,,"When it comes to drought most of our most significant impacts as the Chair touched on earlier, are isolated throughout the inland region.",0.0
False,,And my team as well as Mr. Rabamad's recovery team are spending most of our time addressing drought issues throughout that inland part of California.,0.0

False,,"When it comes to dry wells as the Chair noted, currently there's more than 1,900 wells reported statewide. Tulare County residents have taken the hardest hit with more than 1,200 Dry walls in Tulare County. Approximately 700 of those within the unincorporated community of East Porterville.",0.0
False,,At CalOES our job under the Governor's state of emergency is to direct state agencies in support of local governments.,0.0
False,,Our job is to pull together state agencies to expedite the delivery of emergency resources. To counties as they work to tackle the challenge of getting water to their residents.,0.0
False,,"In September, the Governor authorized us to use the California Disaster Assistance Act to fund local programs, to get residents water for drinking and for sanitation. Those efforts have been considerable.",0.0
False,,Mr Rabamad will get into the details of what we have expended thus far.,0.0
False,,"But currently the primary focus of our programs has been in our southern San Joaquin Valley area, in the Kern County, Tulare County, Fresno, Madera, Merced, and then on up into the foothills in Mariposa and Tuolumne.",0.0
False,,In Tulare County we've got active programs underway. There are approximately 800 homes that are receiving bottled water that's funded through the state water board's clean up and abatement program.,0.0
False,,Our program is supporting the delivery of community water tanks within East Porterville. That provide non-potable water to the residents. Also the establishment of household tanks.,0.0
False,,Our efforts are focused on trying to get a tank in the yard of every home that has a dry well. And currently there's approximately 150 of those tanks that have been installed.,0.0
False,,"And the productions schedule for those installations is increased recently, given our ability to secure some additional water sources for Tulare county.",0.0
False,,"Also in Tulare county, we've been working collaboratively with the Department of Water Resources to secure funding for a well that will immediately help East Porterville with source water for these tanks as we set them up.",0.0
False,,And then in the long term be source water that we can use to help permanently connect at least some initial homes. Approximately 100 to 150 homes in East Porterville to the City of Porterville's water system.,0.0
False,,"We've got additional active programs going in Tuolumne county. In Tuolumne county, we've got close to 200 wells that have run dry.",0.0
False,,We are apparently delivering water to 66 homes. 56 homes had existing. 56 new tanks were installed. Other homes already had tanks in place.,0.0
False,,"Which in our mountain communities, we are finding a lot where there are existing tanks and, so it is much easier for us to deliver water to those communities.",0.0
False,,"Tuolumne county's done an exceptional job too. Through this process, looking at establishing long-term connections. And that's something that we focus on when we work on delivering our program to communities.",0.0
False,,"Is ensuring that they're looking at those long-term solutions, that this is not just putting a tank in someone's yard and walking away. We want to, wherever possible, permanently resolve the situation.",0.0
False,,"So in Tuolumne County, we've got 23 homes that That had dry wells that were connected to the Tuolumne utility district.",0.0
False,,In Mariposa county there's another 50 homes that are receiving water.,0.0
False,,"And we expect in the coming days to see programs launching in Merced and Fresno counties. Those will probably be the next up. Madera County, or excuse me. Madera and Fresno are the next up.",0.0
False,,"Merced County and Kern Counties will probably be coming online after that, and then across the state. And we're seeing more and more counties to the north. That are inquiring about our program, how to utilize the program, how it works.",0.0
False,,Because the program allows counties to establish a relationship with a nonprofit to actually implement these water delivery programs.,0.0
False,,"And we have a number of counties throughout the central valley, and northern Sacramento valley, and here in the Sacramento area. Yellow county in particular that have recently received briefings from our recovery and regional response staff.",0.0
False,,"So as I indicated earlier, the majority of our impact currently are being felt the greatest throughout the inland region.",0.0

And you're having to take a prescription that costs over $6,000 for a single prescription in the first month.",0.0
False,,"How would you pay for this prescription? What would you do? Today we ask consumers with chronic conditions, the most vulnerable among us, to pay this ridiculous cost, for life saving prescriptions that they rely on.

Some health plans reported that their would in fact be zero impact. And some said that the impact could be 0.3% a year. The opposition will also talk about the rising cost of drugs. We get that. But, whose responsibility is it to negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers? Is it the consumer or is it the health plan and the pharmacy benefit manager? This bill gets the consumer out of, what one legislator appropriately described as the clash of the titans. So we present this bill to you today and respectfully request your aye vote.",0.0

False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We're opposed to AB 339 and our opposition to this bill is fairly simple. Legislatively designing health benefits increases premiums, and so we can legislatively create the best benefit package in the world, but if no one can afford them, that's pretty useless from our perspective. And this has been demonstrated time and time again.",0.0
False,,The independent analysis of the introduced version of this bill does show premium increases of close to $400 million on individuals and employers. Now indeed Covered California has recently enacted in the small group and individual markets drug co-pay caps with the assistance of my health plan members that are part of the exchange. But they ran analyses of these caps and these results demonstrated some interesting things.,0.0
False,,"Indeed, the first year impacts on premiums were negligible. But Covered California did project that over a three-year period prices could increase by 3%. And that's a pretty significant percentage from our perspective, considering all of the cost drivers in the health care system. They also mention in their analysis that there is a high degree of uncertainty with the new introduction of drugs, the prices of those drugs, particularly specialty drugs, which makes projecting future year premium impacts difficult.",0.0
False,,"And as we've stated in previous committee meeting hearings, some analysts predict 12 new blockbuster drugs being introduced in 2015, and a blockbuster drug is typically defined as a drug that generates annual sales of at least $1 billion for the company that creates it. These are probably reasons why Covered California also stated that the annual evaluation of the pharmacy benefit Is necessary to adjust benefits as needed. This is to protect premiums and to protect the actual values of the products.",0.0
False,,"Why do acknowledge and appreciate the sunset that's being added to the bill it is a four year sunset. And drugs are expected to get more expensive, not less expensive in the meantime. To bring up last year's poster child for expensive drugs, that was Sovaldi last year at a whopping thousand dollars per pill. The son of Sovaldi, Harvoni, the follow-up pill, was priced at $1300, actually $1350 per pill. That's pretty expensive.",0.0
False,,"We do acknowledge, and these are patent protected products. So the idea of that our health plans have the strongest hand in the negotiation process over these prices. There is at least some question of that. We do acknowledge that the bill is inching closer and closer to the regulations that were developed at Covered California. So we want to thank the author, the sponsor, and the chair for those developments, and credit them for that.",0.0

False,,"And so we do believe it starts with transparency and the rejection of the Orwellian concept that was stated in a previous hearing of this committee of self attested value to society based pricing of drugs, but we think that kind of approach is ill-defined and will lead to cost increases.

False,,"Chair members of the committee, I'm very excited about this bill. I'm out of breath. Anyway, Mark Oprea here on behalf of our client, ChargePoint. As I know that you're aware, this bill is modeled after a measure that was adopted by the legislature last year, relating to solar permitting, solar panel permitting. As many of you know, when a customer is looking to purchase a new electric vehicle or a used electric vehicle, one of the issues that they're concerned about is understanding that they will be able to quickly and easily get permits for their EV charging station. This is true not only in a residential situation, but more importantly in a commercial or multi-family dwelling situation. Last year, Assemblymember Muratsuchi carried a bill, AB 2565, with the idea of expanding and authorizing tenants of a building, commercial or residential, to install an EV charging station If they were willing to pay for that. What we got from many of the commercial building owners, as well as residential building owners, was that they wanted to see EV charging stations installed, but that the permitting process was so onerous, complicated and uncertain that they were unwilling to go down that path because of that level of uncertainty. It is our hope that through this measure that the expectation from the driver, as well as the property owner, is understood that this is going to be a seamless and easy process that they can get their EV charging station installed. From the customer perspective, from an automobile purchaser or from a commercial building owner that they know that EV charging stations and there permitting will be expedited. So for that reason we would ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Chairman Bloom and thank you Committee Members for the invitation and for the opportunity to speak to you this morning. I am going to talk to you about the future of California's water and this is based on work that my colleagues and I have done as lead authors of the most recent intergovernmental panel of climate change assessment, the fifth assessment report that was released a couple of years ago and also the National Climate Assessment that was just released last year.",0.0
False,,"So the work I'm going to show you has gone through an extensive amount of peer review and represents the input not only from Berkeley Laboratory but also from many other universities from California and around the country. And it's presented to you, there's going to be sort of a darkness before the dawn flavor to this talk, so just please be aware of that.",0.0
False,,I think we need to look squarely at the challenges that climate change poses to our water supply and then talk perhaps about how we might begin solving that. In collaboration with one another.,0.0
False,,"I am going to start by reviewing briefly the present and I am sure everyone is aware of our present situation, but it is a challenge. We are fortunate to have resources deployed both on the ground, in the air and in space to look at this issue and the changes in California's snowpack are so evident that they are clearly visible from space.",0.0
False,,"These are two images taken from a NASA imager that my group and I use extensively in our own research. These contrast the snowpack in January 2013 on the left, and the snowpack in January 2014 on the right. I was looking for January 2015 and couldn't find it when I was preparing this talk, but believe me, it looks very much like the image on the right.",0.0
False,,"A dramatic decline in snowpack. 2014 also saw some of the, there's a striking image of Mount Shasta from the same time period with essentially no snow on its peak. So this is visible now from space, not just from the ground.",0.0
False,,"This animation shows what the normal snow water equivalent, which is what you would get if you melted all the snow and turned it into a swimming pool of water, how much you should have and it's on the order of 20 to 30 inches worth of water, so close to about a yard of water would normally be present in the Sierras at this time. At the moment, that number is down in the range of inches. It would probably come up to just about your ankle on this same scale.",0.0
False,,"So the IPCC, this Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has now concluded that the declines in snowpack and the earlier peak in snow melt runoff are likely due to global warming. They are now prepared to actually back stop that statement, and say that this is a clear consequence of the fact that the planet is getting hotter. Now if we want to circle back around to why the planet is getting hotter, I'm happy to do so, but I'm not going to deal with that in my talk just now.",0.0
False,,"The drought is projected to continue over most of the American West. So there are portions of the country, fortunately, where it's actually going to wind down or even decrease. Those are to the east of us. This projection that I'm showing you is from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the Federal agency that's really charged, of course, with monitoring our climate, sort of for operational purposes.",0.0
False,,"The brown region shows you where the drought is likely to persist or in fact perhaps intensify. And then you notice that's over most of the American West, except up in Washington and around the Cascade River Basin. So they're saying essentially the prospects for relief between now and midsummer are thought to be low.",0.0
False,,"For obvious reasons, we're exiting the winter monsoon season in California. This has had big impacts on our reservoirs and lakes around the country. These are pictures courtesy of an article that appeared in the Atlantic Monthly last year. So, kudos to the Atlantic Monthly for taking these pictures.",0.0
False,,"I'm sort of focusing on Shasta Lake. Which is well north of us and Lake Oroville, which is just due directly north of us. Both of which in August of last year were at 30% of their normal capacity. And there are lots of pictures in the same article that show houseboats nearly high and dry.",0.0
False,,"I have colleagues in my department who have boat docks where essentially the boats are left stranded etcetera. So that's their current situation. And I think it's fair to ask now whether or not this particular event, this particular drought, is certainly due to climate change. And I have to be honest here. This is a question that the climate community for a single event, like a single drought, cannot yet answer with certainty.",0.0
False,,So I want to be clear here. People frequently make this sort of really casual leap from global warming to single events like this current drought. This is actually a subject of active debate in the community and we're not gonna make a statement that we can't really backstop.,0.0
False,,"And we can't backstop the statement that this drought is demonstrably due to global warming. However, that said, we do know that major decadal long droughts, like the event we're now in, is four years long. Decadal droughts, like this could have caused the west, in previous millennia. They're very common. We know that they occurred, because we can look at lake beds, which have trees all the way down to the bottom. These lakes are only fed by rainfall. So if this lake has trees, fossilized trees at the bottom of the lake, that means that at some point the rain stopped and we know that we can find numerous lakes like that in high ranges around to the east of us in California.",0.0
False,,"We're also confident, and this is perhaps the most important message that I'm now going to segway to, that climate change is going to amplify these historical patterns. So this is one of the key messages I'd like you to take away from today.",0.0
False,,"That even if a single event like the current drought is not necessarily due to climate change, climate change will exacerbate and amplify the tendencies for these events in the future and these will become quite stressing events for the state water supply.",0.0
False,,"So I'm gonna start with the IPCC big picture, and then we'll narrow it down to the water just in California through the National Climate Assessment. So this is the IPCC statements about the risk to the world's water supply. Changes in the water cycle. This means the natural water cycle where water comes from the ocean and from lakes, enters the atmosphere, then falls to the land again, runs off into the oceans and lakes and is replenished is a cycle. It's certainly going to change in a warmer climate for reasons that are due to very basic physics, there's no way to avoid them. This is an unavoidable consequence of climate change in a warmer world.",0.0
False,,"It is almost certain that the changes in precipitation will not be uniform. I'll come back to this point in a minute. What's going to happen, we think, is a very clear pattern, it's a simple takeaway message, the wet get wetter, the dry get drier. We're in a dry part of the country. That's mean we're most likely gonna get drier, for reasons that you'll see in a moment.",0.0
False,,"The snowpack is going to disappear rather dramatically over the 21st century. Also, evaporation will increase. That will be another reason why we're going to lose water. And the one thing we know, almost for certain, is that the snow cover is going to be severely impacted by global warming.",0.0
False,,"So now let me drill down on those points. The basic message here is that climate change amplifies existing patterns. How do we know? We already see these patterns occurring in data. So this diagram is again taken from the IPCC working group report on which I was lead author. All the arrows on this picture, which have little labels on them, for example, changes in ocean heat content, changes in air temperature, changes in water vapor, these are all copiously observed by multiple observing systems. So every arrow on this diagram represents a consensus of many lines of evidence that these aspects of the climate system are changing.",0.0
False,,"And they're changing rapidly, and they're changing in ways that are historically unprecedented, at least over the observational record going back a thousand years. So dramatic climate change. And these patterns is sort of, it's an amplification of trends in the climate system.",0.0
False,,"One of the trends that's particularly important, and I'm showing you some, these are diagrams that are supposed to be sort of user friendly from the IPCC. I'll be interested in your comments in whether you think that they are. So the IPCC is sort of written essentially for Ministers of Climate in the participating countries from the UN General Assembly.",0.0
False,,"The message behind this diagram is that the storm track that brings water to the West Coast through the Pineapple Express, those storm tracks in the Pacific Ocean that bring water to our shores. This storm indicates them moving northward, and they're moving northward very systematically, and I'm going to show you that in the next diagram. We're not sure how this trend is going to play out over the 21st century.",0.0
False,,"But, what it does mean in general is that the areas to the south of us, for example Mexico, are going to get systematically dryer, and the areas to the north of us like Canada and Alaska are going to get systematically wetter. What's going to happen in California over the next few decades is a bit of a coin toss. But again, the wet get wetter, the dry get drier, thanks to climate change.",0.0
False,,"And I'm sorry for this diagram. I'll interpret it for you because it's written in Sundanese, but what this diagram is essentially saying is that the storm tracks are moving northward. Along the coast of California at the rate of tens of kilometers every decade. So play that out over the 21st century.",0.0
False,,"The storm track in the Pacific Ocean that brings water to our shores is likely to move northward by at least 500 kilometers in the 21st century. The diagram, all the data points to the left of the dotted line are actually, measurements from satellites, measurements from meteorological analysis of the present day climates.",0.0
False,,These trends come from present day and this trend in movement in the storm tracks is predicted by extremely simple physics that's baked into the climate system. You can't dodge it. You can't avoid it. It's going to happen.,0.0
False,,"So again, sorry for this flavoreth talk, we're going to sort of work through the darkness before the dawn thing. Then we'll get back to some glimmers of hope toward the end of my talk. I don't really want to focus too, this diagram is extremely busy but the main point of it is the upper right hand portion.",0.0
False,,"There are many aspects of the climate system which are still under debate. But one thing we're virtually certain on and one thing that all the climate models agree on is that we are due for much hotter temperatures. And those hotter temperatures, I realize this temperatures scale is invisible, under business as usual. The inner part of California's going to warm by probably four to five degrees, could warm by four to five degrees celsius by end of century.",0.0
False,,"To translate that into Fahrenheit, seven degrees Fahrenheit. And that's going to be the norm. That will be the normal, and change in the annual mean temperature. Heatwaves under business as usual scenarios end up becoming. What would be regarded an unusual heatwave, becomes the norm. And we actually expect those, what would be regarded as a distressing heatwave, to be occurring essentially for two months every summer, every year. So what this strange weather becomes the norm by the end of the 21st century.",0.0
False,,"And that those high temperatures, of course, increase evaporation. From our lakes, from our water delivery systems that are exposed to air, and I'll come back to this point a little bit later cuz it ends up being kind of a stressing factor. Evaporation alone ends up being a stressing factor for the water system.",0.0
False,,"So the snow pack, we'll talk a little bit about how it's going to change on average. This is some very nice but disturbing work by a colleague of mine, Noah Diffenbaugh who's at Stanford University, and this gets back to this issue around the abnormal becoming the normal.",0.0
False,,"This diagram which, again, I'm sorry for the small size. This diagram on the lower right hand side is showing you how frequently the snow pack will be in March, so like the March we just left will be lower than anything we've experienced over the last 30 years. And what the colors in that diagram show, is that in California extremely low snow conditions will occur every three years, so the abnormal becomes essentially the normal, it'll happen every three years.",0.0
False,,"Up in, if you go up into the mountain ranges around in the State of Washington, it'll be occurring every two years, so they'll be experiencing extremely low snow conditions north of us, so the hope that we will be able to perhaps import our water over the border from our stateside colleagues north of us may be a bit of a false hope.",0.0
False,,"This now is from the National Climate Assessment and my colleague, Mike Wiener, is one of the lead authors in this assessment This sort of shows the impact on the water system mid century. The color scale here, deep red is a 40% decline, so major declines in the water content and Snowpack. Major reductions in run off.",0.0
False,,"You can see how those changes sort of hug the places where there are rivers in the state. Major changes in run off from the sea rise, major changes in runoff along the coastline. Declines of 40%, reductions in soil moisture. All of them occurring because of the reduction in snow.",0.0
False,,"Now, the irony here is that California in total may actually gets more precipitation, why? Because a wetter atmosphere can hold more moisture and that means that the additional moisture can fall on the land surface, but it will fall as rain, not as snow, and we've very much built our water system in the state, at least large portions of it on the concept that snow acts as a time release mechanism for us. We bank the snow in the winter, we recover it in the spring and summer. It's been an incredibly valuable asset for us. That banking feature of the climate system is going to become stressed under climate change. So we may get total, more total water falling in the state. But it won't be falling inside the perimeter of this bank. And that's one of the big challenges that we face going forward.",0.0
False,,"And this is just sort of detailing this projected snow water equivalent decline again. This is broken out now by state, and the contributions of each individual state, the total amount of snow water equivalent in the American west. So obviously states like Arizona don't play a major role. California and the states to the north and east of us do.",0.0
False,,"These projections are showing declines by you know, on the order of about 60%. By the end of century, this is under a business as usual scenario. And you should point out by the way that this business as usual scenario is actually under predicting what we think climate change will be. This is a scenario for how aggressive greenhouse gas emissions will be, this scenario turns out to be an underprediction of how bad the rate of emissions increase is. So in other words, this is an underestimate of how severe the impact will be by the end of the century.  And so this says that the bank, the water bank, in the form of snow water equivalent, is going to be roughly 40% of what we've enjoyed during this century.",0.0
False,,"This has major impacts, particularly in the State of California. This is showing, again I'm sorry for the small font, but showing you the impacts in state So what this diagram is showing you is that the San Joaquin River Valley for example has 40 percent less water in it by the latter part of the century.",0.0
False,,"Ironically, other parts of the country will actually see increases in the amount of water inside their river basins, but we will face the impact of the lower banking of water, and that plays out, both on the San Joaquin, the Sacramento and the Klamath rivers by the end of the century. And again this is all information coming out of the National Climate Assessment.",0.0
False,,"So stream flow for the major rivers systems are predicted to fall by north of 20% by mid century and even more by the latter part of the century. So that's surface water. The other, the safety valve for this system for California has been the, like in another bank. This is a bank that is not being refreshed, it's being refreshed every year but it takes much longer than the creation rate takes a lot longer. This is ground water, and we're fortunate to have some gigantic aquifers under, for example, the California Central Valley that we've been able to enjoy and use.",0.0
False,,"Those systems are also in distress because they have to be replenished in order for them to be there for future generations to enjoy, and this is coming again from the National Climate Assessment a little bit later in the chapter that deals with water impacts.",0.0
False,,"And they break out the use of groundwater sector by sector. If you look at the total withdrawals per square mile, California has one of the largest. It's something like 500,000 gallons per square mile annual usage over much of the state and that's completely dominated by agricultural use. So about 80 to 90% of it is agricultural use. So we're definitely using the aquifer is a particularly important bank.",0.0
False,,"The challenge, well, let me just deal with that banking issue for a moment. So that bank is replenished every year by rainfall and from water coming from rivers at a rate of about 2 million acre feet per year. So that's the input into the bank thanks to Mother Nature. The withdrawals averaged over the 80s and 90s were, so the human withdrawals from that system were six times larger.",0.0
False,,"They were on order 12 million acre feet with maybe nine of that being put back thanks to losses from the agricultural system with a net loss to the system of 1 million acre feet a year. So, you put in 2 from nature, withdraw 12, put back 9, net loss of 1. That weight of loss and depletion has increased dramatically in the recent past.",0.0
False,,"So, that's clearly not sustainable if you want the bank to be there in the future. And the other challenge that we face with respect to water withdrawals, and I'm coming down to my closing slides here, is that thanks to evaporation. So, population, despite for a variety of complex reasons, probably because of substitution for humans into Central Valley in place of agricultural production. Population growth alone is not expected to really, greatly accelerate the stress on water withdrawals. That's what's shown on the left-hand diagram here. But once you fold in the fact that you're losing water thanks to increased temperature, you need more water to cool things. You're losing more vapor evaporation. You're going to significantly increase water demand just thanks to the fact that you have a hotter climate.",0.0
False,,"So all this is adding up to our two major water banks are getting depleted. You have a bigger demand, thanks to higher temperatures. So that's what this is now sort of a summary of the stresses that's coming out of the National Climate Assessment. This is just a reprise of what I've told you on the previous slides. So that's the challenge facing us. I think the question now facing the state is, how do we move forward?",0.0
False,,"One of the ways that we and the scientific community can work with the state is providing a more actionable, more accurate projections of climate change. And I wanted to touch on that, that point in my last few slides, then turn to your questions. We are building some of the world's most advanced models for the present day and for the future climate.",0.0
False,,"We were one of the first groups in the world to construct models, and this would've been in animation, but I chose just a series of single slides, as able to project climate change down to scales of 25 kilometers. We're building models that can resolve climate down to the scale of the width of San Francisco. We are surely to have models that can project micro-climates down inside the bay of San Francisco.",0.0
False,,"So this capability is coming online soon. We're testing these against the present-day climate. We are intensely interested in making these models useful to the state, and we welcome the opportunity to deploy this capability in working with the state in understanding how climate change will effect our water supplies, and what we can do about it.",0.0
False,,"And the other thing that's running to the rescue is the fact that this state has one of the most advanced technological bases in the world. We're bringing online computers which will allow us in the next 10 years to project climate. We can currently project climate down to scales of 200 kilometers, 25 kilometers, now 1 kilometer. So that soon should be able to resolve the, what's going on inside the City of San Francisco, for example, or between Sacramento and Davis, by the year 2020. Quite a powerful capability.",0.0
False,,"So the message I would like to leave you with is that there are opportunities for real and dynamic partnerships that involve an exchange of knowledge between the state, local entities, special districts, municipalities, state agencies, and the University laboratory system. We're ready and willing to engage in that conversation. I think it will allow us to harness the best researching technology available, you know, essentially worldwide to tackle the problem in state.",0.0
False,,"I think we could be very smart about how we go about tackling this problem. And really what we're offering is one of the world's best crystal balls about what could happen. That's what we're bringing to the table. And also a technological base and an interest in engaging, with all the other citizens in the State of California and how to solve this problem, both to adapt and mitigate it. So, thank you very much. Be happy to take any questions you might have for me.",0.0
False,,"Right, so as you warm the planet, one of the things that changes, and the reason why the storms are affected, is that the whole structure of the climate system is being altered. The poles actually both the North Pole and the South Pole are getting appreciably hotter than land further South.",0.0
False,,"And so you're altering, one of the major drivers for the circulation, in the climate system is the difference between very hot tropics and the very cold poles. That's a very basic driver in the climate system.",0.0
False,,"That difference between the hot tropics and the poles is being reduced because the poles, Alaska, Antarctica, are heating much more rapidly than land to the further south. And that, combined with some other factors, are literally moving the circulation system around.",0.0
False,,So this alteration in the large scale circulation of the atmosphere is following because you're altering the basic structure of the temperatures that we've historically enjoyed.,0.0
False,,"I think we're at the, this movement of the storm tracks falls out of very basic theory, it also falls out of the climate models. The climate models, I think, actually predicted it before it was observed. So this is a pretty direct consequence of global warming.",0.0
False,,"It's one of those things like higher moisture in the atmosphere that falls directly out of pretty basic physics of the climate system. It was predicted analytically before it was observed from satellite, and a colleague of mine at the University of Washington first observed it from satellite.",0.0
False,,"We now know this is occurring and it's a consequence of global warming. So what, the thing that's a little tricky right now is the reason why I wasn't able to give a crisper message about the consequences for the State of California, is that while the climate models all say yes, it's moving northward, at the moment they, some of them have this storm track position too far south, some of them have it positioned too far north.",0.0
False,,"And if you look at the net effect from averaging all the climate models together, you get what amounts to a bit of a coin toss. We're quite confident, though, that regions that are further north, like Canada, will get wetter, and regions that are much further south, like Mexico and Central America, are gonna get appreciably drier.",0.0
False,,"Let me take a crack at this initially, because this is my area of expertise, my personal research is in the causative agents for global warming. So it is true, and if you go to the Grand Canyon you can see a beautiful record of natural climate change that goes back half a billion years, right?",0.0
False,,"So, we know that climate change has occurred naturally in the past, and we know that climate has changed here in California, again, due to natural causes, so let's fast forward over to the present, and on time scales of decades to centuries, there are two quick actors of natural climate change.",0.0
False,,One of them are volcanoes. So the Pinatubo eruption that went off in the 1990's eliminated half of the warming that occurred since pre-industrial times. So the climate had warmed by Roughly three quarters of a degree centigrade relative to pre-industrial times.,0.0
False,,"Pinatubo cancelled half of that, over a three year period. So that's a fast actor, it put up this big screen of sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere, reflected sunlight back to space. Acted sort of like a screen parasol over the whole earth. The second fast actor is the sun.",0.0
False,,"So the sun, for example, caused what's known as the little ice age that occurred in the 17th century. You can see this in paintings all over Europe. People skating on the Thames, people skating on rivers all over Europe that were frozen solid.",0.0
False,,"The sun went quiet and that caused a, and this was observed by Galileo, and his colleagues, and this caused a cooling in the climate system. This can convert back quite quickly. We actually have very good data on both of those, neither of them explain what we're seeing now.",0.0
False,,"There's a clear fingerprint of mankind's signature that cannot be explained any way else, and the physics of this Plotie points to green house gases. And that is that the lower atmosphere is warming, the stratosphere is cooling, there's no way you get that from volcano's. No way to get that from the sun.",0.0
False,,"The only way to get it is by changing the green house gases. We also know, thanks to very good chemical evidence that the increase in carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere is man made. How do we know that? Because there's a signature of the carbon source and its isotopic composition, is sort of the weight of the carbon that's in carbon dioxide.",0.0
False,,"Plants favor light carbon, that decays away, and you get a completely different massive, it's a different isotropic signature of fossil fuel emissions. What we're seeing in the earth's atmosphere is a clear fingerprint that the increased carbon dioxide is from fossil fuel emissions, and also a clear fingerprint because the lower atmosphere is warming.",0.0
False,,"The upper atmosphere is cooling. That warming is due to greenhouse gases. This is evidence that has not been challenged. So, a very quick answer to your question, but as far as we know, and we know a lot, most of the warming that we're seeing now is man made.",0.0
False,,"And of course, there's still skeptics who are contending that this is not the case ,they have not yet been able to deal a serious blow, a serious blow to this diploid issue that I mentioned to you about warmer surface, cooler stratosphere, and the isotopic evidence is also uncontested.",0.0
False,,"And that's a very clear fingerprint, that the carbon dioxide is coming from fossil fuels, no other source. And it's not for volcanoes either. That's another, you know little ringer in the dark, but the admissions from volcanoes are orders amounted to lower than man made emissions of CO2.",0.0
False,,"Bottom line, sorry for that very rapid data dump on you, but the conclusion to data dump is that we are very confident that mankind is causing the Global Warming that we're seeing now.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.",0.0
False,,We're playing catch the hot potato. Do you want to take that first?,0.0
False,,"I think one issue we haven't touched on today that could be a bit of a joker in the deck is sea level rise, for a couple of reasons. This is one of those issues where there are black swan events that could represent quite stressing events for parts of the coastline. And it actually does come up in the context of water because you so often see major water treatment facilities at basically low elevations cuz they're being gravity fed, right, so you're feeding water into a water treatment plant or something that's close to shoreline because that's where it's being fed from communities or industries uphill. The estimates of sea level rise between the fourth assessment report on which I was also lead author and the fifth assessment report increased by a factor of three. So they went from 30 centimeters, because we didn't include land glaciers and ice sheet decline, to a meter, a sort of central estimate. But that meter has what we call a fat-tailed distribution, so it has a long tail that goes to much higher impacts. And the upper bound on that was about 2 meters, so 6 feet by 2100. So this intersects, both this issue on adaptation and what the communities are gonna do, but also intersects with the water system. And it's been, I will say, this is probably a side bar to your immediate question but It's been interesting trying to discuss with communities around the Bay Area how they plan to address this. And the challenge that we face, I think, which may get into some other issues, is that the shoreline or the bay system, if I'm not mistaken, is about 500 linear miles with about 150 different agencies and other entities that govern that shoreline. How you come up with, and I'm not being parochial, how do you deal with just that entity, the Bay Area, much less the rest of the coast of California, and come up with a consensus position around adaptation that logically deals with the issues of intersectional communities, water, and governance is one where I think, we don't yet really have an adequate strategy for dealing it, cuz it touches so many sectors. And so that's an area I just wanted to flag for this Committee's consideration. Where, I think concerted action is required and the appropriate mechanisms for that concerted action may not yet be in place.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, my name is Will Barrett I'm with the American Lung Association of California. I first want to thank you for holding this great discussion today. This is actually National Public Health Week and yesterday President Obama and the Surgeon General made climate change at the forefront of all the messaging they did because of the significant health impacts that climate change is having and will continue to have without strong leadership.",0.0
False,,"We believe California's leadership is really leading the way on reducing air pollution and fighting climate change. We think that, along with many of our public health colleagues, that this is really critical to protecting public health, especially in our most disadvantaged communities as Strella noted.",0.0
False,,"Our research at the Lung Association, we found that AB 32 programs are really working and really reducing the air pollution and respiratory health impact of air pollution as they cut carbon pollution. The low carbon fuel standard and the cap and trade program for fuels, we found that by 2025 that these programs together will cut about $8 billion worth of health damages.",0.0
False,,"That's thousands and thousands of asthma attacks avoided because we're cleaning up our fuels. Similarly, we did a report last year on the San Joaquin Valley implementing SB 375 smart growth strategies, and found that there throughout the valley, more walkable communities could really reduce the health damages by about $400 million a year over current sprawl oriented growth.",0.0
False,,"So I just wanted to kind of say that I appreciated Dr. Greenblatt for noting that we need to move our climate and pollution policies together, really to maximize both at the same time. California's made tremendous progress, but we still have out 70% or more of our population living in counties with unhealthy air.",0.0
False,,"So we know we need to do more. We know we need to celebrate the success we've had. But we also need to invest more into clean technology, we need to reduce air pollution and climate change, but also in the smart growth strategy, the natural resource strategies that we heard about today.",0.0
False,,"We strongly support all of the investment discussion that Strella brought up in the 535 quad recommendations and just wanted to again thank you and look forward to working with you to protect the public health and air quality in California as we fight climate change and continue to lead the fight, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Okay, good morning. My name is Kevin Aslanian. I'm with the Coalition of California Welfare Rights Organizations.

False,,"It has been denied in years past, but we should mention that the department this year did exclude some populations, many of which are going to be new to managed care. They sought to model it after systems that other enrollees partake in in other aspects of the health system. So we think those should be taken into consideration favorably as this is held open. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Madam Chair. Eduardo Martinez, California Medical Association. We are also in opposition to this proposal. We've been opposed to it in the past. The last conversation about rates is illustrative in this bigger proposal.",0.0

False,,"There may be a situation where perhaps a provider can no longer participate in a given plan, has been seeing the patient for quite some time, has to decline participation in that plan anymore, but is still going to participate in another plan that perhaps is not passing along those cuts.

False,,"And indeed, certain elements of our health plan community are in opposition. However, we are committed to exploring alternatives to replace the existing tax. We do understand that we are in this situation because of federal intervention, apparently which requires a much broader application to any Medicaid-provider tax.",0.0

False,,"In the meantime the existing MCO tax structure remains in effect, which is important because at least in the budget year there is no fiscal impact to the state in not taking immediate action. We believe it's important to take advantage of this time because as addressed in some of the testimony already, that a hasty solution could lead to some drastic market impacts.",0.0
False,,"So under the principle that we have more time, we will continue discussions with the administration, to determine whether an alternate exists, that directly benefits the Medi-Cal program, is equitable to the payers of the tax.

False,,"Bland was referring to that families get that's only 30% of the caseload. 70% of the caseload has a grant level that is minus one person. In 70% of the caseload for a family of two, rather than getting 547, two people get 333 a month.",0.0
False,,"And the reason for that is because the parent's have been penalized, have been sanctioned, or they have an MFG child or they've timed out. So the program if you look at the average grant it's actually 509 a month. And that's only 31% of the federal poverty level and 21% of the supplemental poverty level.",0.0
False,,"So, we should do away with the maximum grant and also try to fight back the sanctions. We would hope that we could meet with the department and try to work on trying to reduce sanctions. Counties have $90 million a year to cure sanctions. That is in the single allocation.",0.0

Please give us the 10% rate that we deserve. All of us disabled in California deserve it, and we're hurting, so stop it, please.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chairman and members. Thank you for your patience for today and this hearing really appreciate this. My name is Carl London. I'm here on behalf of the California Disability Services Association. We have close to a hundred community based agencies statewide, also a parent, also the current President of a local agency here in Sacramento.",0.0
False,,"So, I'm touching in this field on a lot of different angles. One of the biggest problems you have here that hasn't been talked about is the fact that, back in the late 90s, we froze rates and decided that we would have a conversation about how we were going to set rates. We never fixed that.",0.0
False,,"Nobody ever went back and picked that back up. And all the rates were just based off of those figures at that time. And what you see in this rate chart is just the history of what's happened since then. When you go back to 2006-7, you'll see we had an across-the-board increase largely due to this Budget Subcommittee taking control of the issue,",0.0
False,,"forcing it, with three legislators that were moms, one that was a brother, bipartisan group that took ahold of this issue and urged the Legislature and the Governor to put the funding in like we're talking about today. We're revisiting this moment again,",0.0
False,,"and this time we're coming to you with a different way of handling it. People always ask us, where are you going to get the money? It's sitting right there in the developmental centers. The faster you do this judo flip, the faster you'll have the money available to help fix the community and make it better for 280,000 people, not a thousand. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Assemblymember Reginald Byron Jones-Sawyer, Sr., from Los Angeles.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, and thank you for your report, and I'm very familiar with your report. You do excellent work. And actually, this is kind of seems a little eerily familiar to me. With the course, for example, there's an operating overhead group that makes all the budget decisions for everyone else. And the money should flow down to basically the people who actually do the work.",0.0
False,,"And the additional audits you did for me, we've, or you found, as you looked at how the money flowed, and this is all about transparency, opportunities where we could reprogram, or we found out that there's hundreds of millions of dollars that were spent at the upper level that should have probably gone down to lower courts. What both the Chairman are asking now, is that something you could also look at? But more importantly, have you looked at that right now? Especially as far as transparency is concerned.",0.0
False,,"Are there monies that are being held back? Or have been purpose or should be repurposed in another fashion, or you don't have access to that information that we could make some comments on as a Committee to look at from the legislative standpoint.",0.0
False,,"Is what the Chair is asking now if that's something that could be incorporated, or is something we could look at?",0.0
False,,"Correct. Thank you Mr. Chairman. As you probably can tell, this whole issue of diversity is not going to go away. And I just wanna add this because you were talking about numbers and money. Spending $3 million out of state and $20 million in state, but",0.0
False,,"it seems like the out of state money's more effective at bringing in students one. Two, money isn't always the solution. And I think you should seriously look at the $20 million you're spending, because it obviously is not working. And to continue to pour money down that drain, that hole, expecting to get a different result is problematic.",0.0
False,,"I went to a real small private college in Los Angeles where our enrollment in African Americans is much higher than UCLA's. Our tuition is twice as much as UCLA and we've had a history of not always being accepting to minorities, except with Latino, African American enrollment, it's much higher than UCLA's. And that's problematic on a lot of levels.",0.0
False,,"And so, no disrespect to the people who believed in Prop 209. But if I hear another person tell me what they can't do, because of Prop 209, I'm gonna lose it, because we need to start talking about what we can do in spite of 209, to get the diversity that we need.",0.0
False,,"And if you haven't heard anything from this panel, the UC's better figure it out and figure it out quick, or we're gonna try to figure it out our own selves. And from what I've learned being a bureaucrat in the system, you never want elected officials to figure out what to do. You need to figure it out yourself.",0.0
False,,"Because if we come up with a plan, it'll be swift, it'll be broad ranging, and it'll be decisive. And so, if the University truly believes in diversity where on a campus of UCLA to have less than 3% African-American males on campus, god forbid if I take out the football team where your numbers would be?",0.0
False,,"It is, you should be ashamed and you should be embarrassed at the numbers all across the State of Latino and African Americans that they're on your campuses right now. And that should be a number one priority, and that should be an easy fix. If you're very good at going out of the country to get people to come to this school and",0.0
False,,"pay an exorbitant amount of money, you should be able to figure out how to stay in-state, spend less money to recruit people to come to our schools and stay in our state and be productive members of our state and just stop this word game. And again I don't care if you give $100 million, if you're not getting the impact that you need you shouldn't spend one dime, or we shouldn't give you one dime or we should give that money to somebody else who'll get the job done.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Madam Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We're, as the payers in the healthcare system are primary payers, both in commercial coverage and as part of Medi-Cal, we're very interested in this $300 million set aside.",0.0
False,,"We think it's very significant, not just in terms of it's size but the fact that the state is reserving this amount of money for one drug or one set of drugs. There is no questioning the advancement in healthcare that are made with these products but, again as it pairs in the system, we do have some concerns about the underlying pricing that is worrisome for both public programs and commercial coverage.",0.0
False,,"We did hear, Madam Chair members, in a State Senate hearing not to long ago that the makers of the Hepatitis C drugs do not use the cost development to price their products. We find that to be a bit curious and contrary to what the drug industry has been saying for years about why some of the products cost so much and it's also a different standard than other sectors of the health care system are required to live under.",0.0
False,,"We are very interested and encouraged by the fact the state is making progress in their negotiations on rebates with the makers of these drugs. We do want to point out this isn't just about Civaldi, as an earlier witness testified, it's about the pipeline.",0.0
False,,"70% of the new FDA approvals in 2013 were specialty drugs which tend to be higher on the price tag end. It's also expected that in 2015, 15 new blockbuster drugs will be entering the market. And so we have some concerns about how we're gonna be paying for that in various sectors.",0.0
False,,"We feel that the need needs to be on affordability, transparency to answer some of the outstanding questions. And we would suggest that the budget committees ask the LAO In addition to the work that they're doing as part of the May revise, the LA or any other appropriate state entity to take a longer term analysis of what these hepatitis C drugs may cost the state in the future.",0.0
False,,"We agree with some of the earlier comments about how that number could change, it could change in either direction. You're right to say that Senator Stone to say that about 3,500 lives would be covered under the 300 $1 million set aside. But we've seen information suggesting that there is 600,000 Californians that have hepatitis C and about 100,000 of those are in the state system in the various programs.",0.0
False,,"I think the numbers around 93, 95,000 so it may not be enough so we're very concerned about this and to both Senator Stone and Senator Monning's question, you made good points about the cost comparison of Sovaldi and Harvoni to existing treatments. We do have some information from a couple of our health plans that might be helpful that I'd like to come in and talk to you about, but in essence it's not a simple analysis of what the cost of the drug is between current forms of treatment.",0.0
False,,"I'm not a clinician, but I understand from one of my health plans that only about 1% of current hepatitis C sufferers end up at a point where they need a liver transplant. So those costs are large but a lot more people are eligible potentially to take Solvaldi and Harvoni so that needs to be part of the assumption as well. In any case, thank you for your time.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Madam Chair, Mister Chairman, staff. My name's Jeff Faca, representing the California Association of School Business Officials. Our organization represents approximately 4,000 individual members, as well as hundreds of local education agencies with the primary focus on school business and finance issues. So needless to say, facilities is a key priority for our members this year.",0.0
False,,"And I wanna begin my testimony by being transparent about what our positions are on the various issues that you've been discussing today. Number one, we do support placing an education bond on a state-wide general election ballot in 2016. Second, we oppose the use of Proposition 98 funds as a source for the statewide facilities program.",0.0
False,,"And I may come back to that in a moment. And then third, we believe strongly that any new statewide School Facilities Program must maintain the historic partnership between the state and local districts for financing school facilities. One of the, I think, recurring themes of the testimony today is that partnership, and so I will loop back to that at the end of my testimony.",0.0
False,,"I will also provide my prepared remarks to your staff following the hearing because many of the issues that I had intended to speak about have already been addressed, and I don't I want to be duplicative.",0.0
False,,"I did wanna say that I was very impressed with the principles that were laid out by Mr. Vincent, and I would suggest to the Committee that that may be an excellent yardstick by which to judge the various proposals that are before the Committee today, and that will be discussed over the course of the year. I also want to reinforce the point that has been made numerous times today and that's of simplicity.",0.0
False,,"Senator Liu, I think you have found a chart that is finally more complicated than how local budget approvals align with the adoption of LCAPs. And when I hear all the talk about simples I sometimes think back to the line in the the movie The Princess Bride, where they say I do not think you know what that word means. Clearly, there is work to be done on that point.",0.0
False,,"I also think it's important that we not lose sight of the importance of facilities in the context of the LCFF and local control accountability plans that each LEA must prepare and now update on an annual basis. Quote, unquote school facilities being maintained in good repair is a key component to the eight state priorities that LEA's are required to address in there L caps.",0.0
False,,So clearly facilities remain a very high priority for the state. And I think it's a fair question to ask whether with that priority and expectation comes a responsibility to maintain that historic partnership. The questions outlined in your agenda really go hand to hand.,0.0
False,,"Political and fiscal challenges and local options. There are really, I think, fiscal challenges as well as political challenges with each of those local options. As others have stated, there is a solid recent history of school districts being able to approve general obligation bonds at the local level.",0.0
False,,"In 2014, 85 of the 108 bond proposals that were on the ballot were approved for a total of 8.9 billion. So as a whole, it's safe to say that if you look at the detail within those bond proposals, it really covers the entire gamut of the issues that you're talking about today. New construction, modernization.",0.0
False,,"Bringing facilities up to standard. New technologies to meet with new assessments, etc. So that's obviously good news for districts that were able to pass the bond. But I think we can't lose, again, lose sight of the fact that there are also numerous districts that have tried to pass the bond numerous times, multiple times, and have failed in their efforts to do so.",0.0
False,,"And you only need to look as close as Woodland Unified School District, which had a pretty significant proposal on the ballot last November, and I think received somewhere in the neighborhood of 43%. So it's not universal, that rate of passage.",0.0
False,,"I won't go through the bonded indebtedness limits and the tax rate limits that were adopted as part of Proposition 39 in the year 2000. But, I do wanna make a couple of comments about those with respect to the waivers being granted by the State Board of Education.",0.0
False,,"Based on the data that I looked at, going through the annual waiver reports from 2009 to 13. And then looking at some data that the Department of Education was able to provide. It appears that there were roughly 40 of those waivers approved between the year 2000 and the year 2013, but 10 of those were in 2013 alone.",0.0
False,,"And I think that it's only anecdotal, but it may indicate a trend of more districts going to the state board to waive those limits, and getting at something that Mr. Vinson spoke about, those limits come into play as a challenge for school districts, because the research has shown that disparities in school facilities funding across the state are systematically related to the assessed value of property within those districts.",0.0
False,,"So if you're a school district for example, and Senator Block you made reference to winners and losers within your own region, if you're a school district in areas of the state that have had very low accessed valuation. Increases or even decreases during the great recession.",0.0
False,,"Riverside County, many rural areas and even if you're able to pass bonds in those communities, you may have issues generating the amount of funds that you need in order to, for example, replace temporary classrooms with new construction.",0.0
False,,"And then I almost to hesitate to bring this up but, bond capacity has led to some other issues. I think Senator Lui, Senator Block, you'll both recall legislation that came through the Senate Education Committee in 2013 that was authored by Assembly Member John Buchanan on the use of capital appreciation bonds.",0.0
False,,Now there was a reason that districts were using capital appreciation bonds as a tool in order to maximize the amount of funding that they could receive in order to meet the needs and the desires of their community and the needs of their master plan.,0.0
False,,"But obviously, the longterm debt that was resulting from some of those issuances was becoming an issue both for local and statewide decision makers. And so now we do have statutory restrictions on the use of that tool, which I think, many districts were using in what people would agree was in a responsible manner.",0.0
False,,"There are some other options that school districts can use beyond general obligation bonds. But I think that those come with challenges as well. There are certificates of participation or COPS, which is a way similar to using lease financing for roughly the same purposes of a general obligation bond.",0.0
False,,"Sometimes those look very much like a GO bond. And other times, they're used for smaller projects or purchases up to, and including, the construction of a new school. COPS do not require voter approval. But, they carry a certain amount. Perhaps significant risk in that the debt is service to do allocations in district's General Fund.",0.0
False,,"So, this is a fiscal challenge because the last thing that any chief business official wants to do is put his or her general fund at risk. And they think of political challenge as well, because I know from talking to many members and staff in the capital, that there have been many issues and a good amount of skepticism about the use of COPS, as a primary tool to finance school facilities.",0.0
False,,"There are also bond anticipation notes, or bans, which in it's simplest form is a way to provide bridge financing for facilities in the short term. When, as the name applies, it's anticipated that a distract will issue bonds sometime in the near future.",0.0
False,,"Those instruments are limited to terms of five years, but also carry risks and that it's never easy to predict the future. And if your bridge financing turns out to be a bridge to nowhere, then you've got a problem on your hands. There are lost or known not frequently use tools grant anticipation notes which are dependent on the future source of revenue.",0.0
False,,"Tax revenue anticipation notes, which are more commonly used for cash flow issues, but there are also examples of using those to finance facilities, improvements, and constructions. And then of course, a school district can also choose to establish a community facilities district under the Mello-Roos act. Or a school facilities improvement district.",0.0
False,,"Those bonds issued in those districts are a flat special tax on property owners within, in the case of the community facilities district, on property owners and taxpayers within the school facilities and improvement district. One risk that was associated with the CFDs during the period of the recession was the risk of default.",0.0
False,,"And I've been told that at one time that the delinquency rate, or the delinquent rate on those was actually 1 in 10 was in jeopardy of being in default. So again, there are options. You know, if someone were to ask me, which they don't frequently do, I would probably caution the use of any of those other debt instruments, but I think at the end of the day, when we're talking about what's the message to take out of all this, it's to reinforce what I said at the beginning, which is that the state and local partnership is really the key to the program's success.",0.0
False,,"Now we haven't had a lot of time to absorb and think about the legislative analysts' recommendation, but I do think that we have a fundamental disagreement with even the potential use of Proposition 98 funds for school facilities.",0.0
False,,"To me it just seemed to exacerbate the adequacy conversations that we're already having. And I can't remember, I think it was Mr. Vincent who said another key threshold question really for the Committee and the Legislature is debt. Bad thing, good thing, somewhere in between.",0.0
False,,"I think we would argue that there's nothing irresponsible. You know, there's always exceptions that prove the rule, but nothing irresponsible in the issuance of that. And again, we simply are strong supporters of maintaining that state and local partnership. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Okay, thank you. I'm a labor lawyer. But even though I'm a labor lawyer, I file briefs in a lot of religion cases, including Hosanna-Tabor. University of Great Falls Montana, Pacific Lutheran University, and California Supreme Court.",0.0
False,,"The McKeon case, the CHW case, the Bonds case, the Historical Parking case, the East Bay Asian, and others. So I'm a labor lawyer but I do a lot of other things that have to do with religion, some of which are employment, some of which are not.",0.0
False,,"For 45 years, I graduated in '71, I've represented, for most of the people in this room on the [INAUDIBLE]. For 45 years I've represented religions Religious schools, religious hospitals, and other types of religious entities.",0.0
False,,"I'm familiar with the way many of them operate, the religious work that they perform, and their need for and their constitutional right to religious autonomy. Which includes defining who will be their spokespersons or their ministers and the right to select them. I'd like to start with a few preliminary remarks.",0.0
False,,"That there are some who believe that Josana Tabor was wrongfully decided, or wrongly decided, that the fact of the matter is, is that that is not really an issue, because whether you believe that Josana Tabor was decided correctly or not, it was decided and it was decided 9-0, so it is the law of the land.",0.0
False,,"As an aside, it's one of the few cases on an issue that was potentially divisive but turned out not to be divisive, where there was unanimity. If you look at many of the cases that come up, including the same-sex marriage cases, they tend to be 4-5, so this was very unusual, to have all nine justices agree on something.",0.0
False,,Now there are some that say what Josana Tabor does is that it permits unlawful discrimination and that's not true. And the reason that that's not true is because the ministerial exception is just a form of an exemption. And all of the statutes that we deal with have exemptions.,0.0
False,,"Government employees are exempted from the Fair Employment and Housing Act. Airlines are exempted from the National Labor Relations Act. Agricultural employees are exempted from a lot of laws. So what that means is that the Legislature, in most cases, has determined that we're gonna enact a law.",0.0
False,,"It's gonna say some things are discriminatory but we are going to specifically exempt people and we're going to let those people engage in acts that we're not gonna let others engage in, so all Josana Tabor is a constitutionally required exemption.",0.0
False,,"So if you look at that that way, then you're not looking at the employer engaging in unlawful discrimination because there's no law that applies to them. They have just a exception or an exemption. The ministerial exemption or exception has a stronger basis then the statutory exemptions.",0.0
False,,"The statutory exemptions are voted by legislators. They sometimes are changed, things are added, things are taken away. But this exception, or exemption, is constitutionally compelled and can't be changed by any Legislature, whether it's the state Legislature or the federal government.",0.0
False,,"Now the purpose of the religious schools is obviously to teach, but it's also to foster spiritual growth to inculcate religious beliefs and values and to help the student grow as a person intellectually and spiritually.",0.0
False,,"They have in common with the public schools the basic education, but they are much different than the public schools because of the spiritual factor that they try to inculcate in their students. The schools are parts of the church.",0.0
False,,"They are an integral part of the religion that sponsors the various schools. And the teachers have to at least respect the beliefs of the school and of the religion in order to be effective role models. As a matter of fact, in some of the schools, depending on what religious tradition you're from, it's an act of proselytization.",0.0
False,,"So it's not just to make people good students and to bring them closer to the religion, but to take other people who are not members of the religion and make them part of the religion. So I've been in many, many Third World countries, and as you go around to those Third World countries you see many of our religious organizations establishing schools there and the purpose is to proselytize and to bring new members in.",0.0
False,,"Now the different religions have different views, but they are all fairly consistent. And I just wanna read what some of the major, mainstream religions say about the role of their schools. Because I've said that yes, they have a spiritual function, but you don't wanna believe a lawyer, obviously.",0.0
False,,"Wanna hear what the religions have to say. So what the Lutherans say is that we have educators who model spiritual leadership. They study God's word. They share their personal faith story. They apply the law and the gospel, and they equip the students to act courageously and to be God's people for service and care of others.",0.0
False,,"The Baptists. One of the factors that distinguishes a Christian college from a secular institution is the attention given to and the value placed on spiritual growth. That colleges and universities that emphasize spiritual growth and development alongside intellectual and professional growth will be places where a student stands the best chance of becoming all God wants him or her to be, the Adventist.",0.0
False,,"Education in it's broadest sense is a means of returning human beings to their original relationship with God. The aim of true education is to restore human beings into the image of God. So when teachers take these positions, they are fully aware of the religious nature of the school and they know what to expect.",0.0
False,,"I'm a lawyer. When I became the lawyer and I joined my law firm I knew what to expect. If I am a student who is looking to go to school, I go on the school's website and I read what the school has to say about itself, I know what to expect.",0.0
False,,"If I am an applicant for employment to be a teacher at a religious school, I look on the website and I know what to expect. The rules are there, the faith based nature of the school is there. Now the term minister has been applied broadly, more than just an ordained minister or a credentialed minister.",0.0
False,,"It's been applied by the various courts and this was not in Los taper to music directors, choir directors, seminarians who engaged in maintenance, administrators, a kosher supervisor, and of course like in Hosana Tabor, to teachers.",0.0
False,,"So the ministerial exemption is something that is broader than what we consider to be a traditional minister, or credential minister or chapel. Now if you look at Hosanna Tabor. Hosanna Tabor according to the court spent most of her time teaching.",0.0
False,,"Yet, it's concluded based upon the facts, that she had enough function speaking for the church, that she came under the exception. And Alito and Kagan in their concurring opinion acknowledged that teachers of the faith can qualify as ministers.",0.0
False,,"So we've got a specific ruling of the Supreme Court applying to one teacher. And we've got two of the more liberal justices acknowledging that teachers of the faith, in the abstract, can qualify for the ministerial exception.",0.0
False,,"And as you probably know, the ministerial exception has been long standing in California, much before Josanna Tabor and the Chapman University case and also in the Red Hill case. Now, teachers qualify for the ministerial exception because they are role models and they fulfill the religious mission of the school.",0.0
False,,"And this is something that we call faith integration. And in many of the religious schools, probably most of the religious schools there is an effort to integrate faith into the classroom. And this is a hard concept to understand. So, if you look at Biola University, which is a non-denominational Christian University.",0.0
False,,"They say, describing the Anthropology Department that the anthropology major seeks to provide a holistic understanding of the diversity of human behavior across time and culture, through a distinctly Christian worldview. Why choose chemistry at Biola? The reason is we integrate Biblical training and Christian perspective with science.",0.0
False,,"And you can look at many of the other schools, the religious schools, right on their websites. And you can see that when they describe the most basic of courses, the science courses or the history courses, they're talking about that this is not the same kind of class that you're gonna get at the University of California.",0.0
False,,"That this is a class which is gonna be infused with religion. If you go to the Azusa Pacific University website, which is a nondenominational evangelical University in Southern California, you'll see that they have an entire office of faith integration.",0.0
False,,"And they have a faculty faith integration handbook, which is 81 pages long, which tells the faculty members as to what they're supposed to do to bring faith into the class. Even into classes that have topics that most of us would never think would have any faith based aspects of it.",0.0
False,,"So, if you look at their faculty handbook, and this is separate from their faith based handbook, it says that faith integration is informed reflection on and discovery of Christian faith within the academic disciplines. And it's in order to advance the work of God in the world.",0.0
False,,"So what we have is we've got people who some of us may think of as just teaching normal topics, like history or geology or something that would have no faith counterpart. But we see that the Christian schools and the other religious schools believe that their purpose is to infuse religion into the classroom.",0.0
False,,"And you've got the teachers being responsible for being the spokespeople or the spokesperson for the religion. Now, it is well- Hope that was okay to say bless you, given the topic. Gesundheit. That it's been constitutionally recognized for a long time, even before Hosanna-Tabor, that a religious institution has the right to select its own ministers, and that this is constitutionally compelled.",0.0
False,,"And under the Hosanna-Tabor case, it's not only the establishment clauses and the free exercise clause, but it's freedom of Association. And if you read Hosanna-Tabor, this concept of being able to designate your own spokesman of your religion and religious autonomy goes back to the Magna Carta.",0.0
False,,"So it's not something that we made up when we put together our constitution. It goes back to England, well before we were a country. And in Hosanna-Tabor it became clear that the government can't dictate matters of church governments. The government can't dictate who's gonna speak for the church.",0.0
False,,"The government can't dictate the church's mission. That the church has the right to decide who who will carry its beliefs to the others. And as much as a legislative body, be it state or federal, might want to extend anti-discrimination to areas where the ministerial exception will apply, that's constitutionally prohibited.",0.0
False,,"It just can't be done. Now, the majority in Hosanna-Tabor looked at the facts. They said we're not gonna give you a bright line test. And Professor Griffin noted that too. They looked at a whole lot of facts involving the plaintiff in that case. Justice Thomas, in his own concurring opinion, came up with a test.",0.0
False,,"His test was that the exception applies to schools that consider teachers as a minister. And Alito and Kagan, in the other concurring opinion, noted that ordination was not required. But that what they said to do is to look at the teacher's duties. And those be critical, whether they're critical in performing the mission and spreading the message of the group.",0.0
False,,"There is in labor law, because remember I'm just a labor lawyer. There is a concept that we have called the University of Great Falls, Montana. And the University of Great Falls, Montana is a NLRB case involving assertion of jurisdiction over religious schools. And the US Supreme Court has said that the NLRB cannot do that.",0.0
False,,"And the NLRB has disregarded that, and they've gone up to the circuit several times. And in Great Falls, what the courts said, the DC circuit that's been followed, is that what we're gonna do to determine whether a school is religious or not. And whether they fall under what's called the Catholic Bishop of Chicago Exception Case.",0.0
False,,"It's like an exemption, but it's not. It's constitutionally required, like Hosanna-Tabor is. That what we're gonna do is we cannot troll through the religious beliefs of the school. We can't go in there with a shovel and start digging around to see, really, how religious are they?",0.0
False,,"What we're gonna do is we are going to look at how does the school hold itself out. And if the school holds itself out as being religious, we are not gonna look behind there. And I would suggest that the same standards should be for the ministerial exception.",0.0
False,,"That you take the DC Circuit case in Great Falls, which says you can't troll through their beliefs. We're gonna have to take as faith what they say. And that you apply it in this context too. Now, in summary then, the Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that religious schools have the right to designate who's a minister, who performs their ministerial function, including teachers. And that any effort to deprive them of that right is barred by the first amendment. Thank you very much for your time.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, if I could start somewhere, please? First of all, You're not looking to see whether somebody is a minister. You're looking to see whether they qualify for the ministerial exception.",0.0
False,,"I think the way that the court looks at it is somebody that has as part of their duties, the curating of the message of the particular religion.",0.0
False,,"I said that those are courses that most of us who went to public school, wouldn't think would be faith-based, but faith-based schools bring faith into those kinds of classes.",0.0
False,,You're asking the wrong person because I only went to public school. But I think-,0.0
False,,"The legal distinction would be even if you offer up both sides of the debate that you are advocating one side of the debate. So there are certain religions that believe that the Earth was created relatively recently, as opposed to billions of years ago.",0.0

False,,"Can I point out, excuse me. Go ahead. You're on the diocese so you get to go first.",0.0
False,,"Okay. I don't pretend to be an expert in accreditation standards, even though I did go to the UC system. But we have clients that actually wrestle with these kinds of issues when it comes to getting government money. And we have clients that, I've talked to them, and they have made conscious decisions to pass up on government money, because of some of the strings that are attached to the government money.",0.0
False,,"And that would prohibit them from being able to practice their religion as they see, and get the money. So I don't know about the UC accreditation standards, but I do know that at least my clients do anguish over this issue.",0.0
False,,"They're not trying to have it all. And we've got that situation going on now, where there's an issue of federal bond funding, or state bond funding. And we have a client that may have to give up $165 million, because it's too religious.",0.0
False,,"And it's prepared to give up $165 million if it's too religious because it's gonna stay religious. The other point that I'd like to make and I think that Michael's experience is the same as mine. I've handled hundreds of cases, maybe thousands of cases in the last 45 years for all kinds of employers, including religious employers.",0.0
False,,"In the number of times that the ministerial exception has come up, you could count on less than one hand. I have a case now involving a hospital chaplain. There's not going to be too much argument that that person was a minister.",0.0
False,,"I had another case that was involving a school and it was a person who was an ordained minister and was in the theology department. But other than those two cases, I can't think of any other ministerial exception case that I've handled. And if I haven't handled it, probably nobody in my firm has handled it. So this is not something that happens everyday.",0.0
False,,"If I could make two points. There was one point that seems to come from both sides to me. And that is that all the students aren't of the denomination and all of the faculty are not of the denomination. The California Supreme Court, I think two cases, has rejected that notion as being relevant with respect to religious status. And that's the McKean case and the Kelly case. Those are hospital cases, and they were FEHA exemption cases. And the question was whether they qualified for the religious employer exemption? And the plaintiff said well wait a minute, all of their students, or all of their patients are not Catholic or not Methodist. And all of their employees are not Catholic or Methodist. And the Supreme Court, in both cases, said it doesn't really matter. The other thing is that Smith is really not necessarily the silver bullet. I understand Smith, good generalized rules, general aplicability.",0.0
False,,"But that doesn't give you the right necessarily to legislate a law. Say for example, outlawing morality clauses. And the reason is because if Smith were the law and overrode the ministerial exception, you wouldn't have Hosanah tabled. There you were dealing with a law of general aplicability, the Americans with Disabilities Act. And that law general applicability all to Smith, had to give way to the constitutional rights of the employer and Hosannah Tabled.",0.0
False,,"And teachers that are teaching appropriate coursework would say that, you know. There are some people that believe that the Earth is 5 billion years old, but we don't believe that, and here's why.",0.0
False,,Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans or CAHP. Thank you for inviting me to talk to the Committee about how I spent my summer recess. A lot of it was spent on this issue.,0.0
False,,"By way of background, CAHP represents 46 Knox-Keene licensed health plans under the Department of Managed Healthcare. Our members come in all shapes and sizes. Some of them are nonprofits. Many of them are public, and many of them are private organizations that collectively provide healthcare to about 28 million Californians or about 95% of the healthcare coverage market in the state.",0.0
False,,More than half of our plans participate in the Medi-Cal Managed Care Program in some form or another and we value our partnership with the State of California.,0.0
False,,Today our Medi-Cal Managed Care plans pay the existing iteration of the Managed Care Organization or MCO tax. And because the existing tax is limited to the Medi-Cal plans it does not raise taxes on individuals or employer purchases of coverage.,0.0
False,,"Of course, several things have changed since the original MCO tax was enacted. Number one, the healthy families program no longer exists and that program has been folded into Medi-Cal. The state's entitlement program for lower income Californians, and the MCO tax was in essence transferred to support Medi-Cal as a result.",0.0
False,,"And number two, and more relevant to our discussion today as we've been talking about the federal government has issued guidance suggesting that California's per MCO tax does not currently meet it's parameters. Among other things the MCO tax must be brought into all health plans not just Medi-Cal plans to meet federal guidelines.",0.0
False,,This means that for the first time individuals and employers paying healthcare coverage in the private markets are now being asked by this federal guidance to pay the cost of an MCO tax if it was enacted to meet those parameters. And this last point is important because it embodies really the reason that we're all here.,0.0
False,,"We're not here because of anything the administration has done. We're not here because of anything the Legislature has done. And we're certainly not here because of anything the health plans have done. We're here because for years the federal government matched with federal dollars the existing version of the MCO tax, thus in essence deeming it compliant and now it's changed its mind and it wants all plants to pay the tax.",0.0
False,,"So therefore under the new federal construct the MCO tax is now a health care coverage affordability issue for the first time which is challenging, but despite this challenge and this new reality, our trade association believes that California's existing MCO tax provides important financial support to Medi-Cal, which is why we made the decision to work constructively within our membership with the administration and with the Legislature to find an alternative tax if it exists that can fill the hole in the Medi-Cal budget and garner a broad based health plan support in process.",0.0
False,,"Number one, you don't have to tax managed care plans under these rules. There are a list of 19 classes of taxable entities that could be considered as a part of a federal Medicaid provider tax.",0.0
False,,"So using what we learned we did start to construct and test certain models. We looked at flat taxes, we looked at tiered taxes, we looked at enrollment based taxes, we looked at revenue, primarily using at first publicly available data.",0.0
False,,"We initially modeled 21 different versions of an MCO tax, and each time we ran into the same issues. One model would achieve equitability but was not affordable. Other tax constructs could be made less expensive to the private markets, but at the expense of fairness in the tax structure.",0.0
False,,So at a certain point in time we felt it was time to get creative and what we've done is we've asked for more refined data directly from our health plan membership in order to test a new round of models that we hope can better align with the principles that we laid out.,0.0
False,,"Of course, this process takes time. Many of the plans felt that the data that we were asking for was proprietary so we had to ensure the sensitive handling of plan data and we have not concluded the process of our latest round of modeling as of yet.",0.0
False,,"I think in short, the task of creating an alternative MCO tax is made very difficult by the constraints of the federal guidance and as I stated, a solution that meets our goals has yet to emerge from the efforts that we have embarked on, but as I indicated, we are currently in the middle of one such process.",0.0
False,,"Fortunately, the federal government is allowing states to keep their current MCO tax in place until the end of their respective legislative session. This give California all of 2015 and 2016, to find an alternative to the tax that is equitable, supports Medi-Cal and is affordable.",0.0
False,,"In the meantime, the current MCO tax remains in place generating revenue and does not expire until 2016. That doesn't say if a solution unveiled itself next week, that we shouldn't do that, but we haven't found a solution at this time and it's just important to understand that the federal government deems current MCO taxes in compliance until the end of session and I think others, and we would agree with that and interpret that to mean the end of a two year session if your session is two years.",0.0
False,,"So I would just quickly close by say that we do appreciate that this Committee is attempting to tackle a very complex equation to ensure that the safety net stays whole, while also protecting affordability for small businesses and employers.",0.0
False,,Health plans have been and continue to work hard to find the right calculation that can achieve all of our goals. We do look forward to continue our work with the administration and we've had some positive discussions there so that we can continue our efforts. Thank you very much.,0.0
False,,"Right. No, thank you for that question. Currently, all current taxes and fees are a component of health plan premiums and we would expect that to continue with anything that was added by the Legislature.",0.0
False,,"It'd be very difficult to absorb a tax of this size depending on what was passed by the Legislature. Just by way of example, one of the problems that we did see with the administration's proposal was that for certain mid size commercial plans the burden of that tax is very high and for one of them it actually doubled the amount of tax that it owed to the State of California.",0.0
False,,So it would be very difficult to just absorb that level of taxation. So those are costs that are gonna have to be borne somewhere in the healthcare system.,0.0
False,,"I don't have a precise number. Our play- It's kind of a- We estimate that 28 million lives are covered DMHC products. About 10 million of those or so, are Medi-Cal Managed Care, so your would subtract those lives. But I don't have a finite number for you, but we can work on that.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, so must directly benefit the Medi-Cal program, be equitable to the payers of the tax, and consider affordability to purchasers.",0.0
False,,Affordability to purchasers.,0.0
False,,"Obviously, the plans are gonna have to make a determination about what they deem affordable to their individual purchasers of health care whether those be individuals or employers.",0.0
False,,"We do believe that the publicly available proposals that we've analyzed hit the commercial markets in the neighborhood of hundreds of millions of dollars in aggregate total taxes to the private sector. For example, the administration's proposal in January pegged it at the commercial cost to be about $650 million to private payers.",0.0
False,,"That's with the tiers, yeah. And then as stated by the LAO. Could go up another $300 million. Yeah, it could go up.",0.0
False,,"So that is an amount of taxation that obviously is gonna be as we said, it's gonna factor into healthcare affordability and cost and certain employers that employ about 200 people or more, already see their taxes in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars.",0.0
False,,"Of course, the employees pay a part of that, and the employers pay a part of that, but to have that aggregate number laid on top of what's already paid is a problem. So the trick is to see if you can lower it to an absorbable amount. Obviously the employer community is gonna have something to say about that a well.",0.0
False,,"So I can't give you a certain number of what that would mean, but it would have to be taken into context of all of our other principles and all other factors that would be in the mix.",0.0
False,,"I hope this answers your question. The latest figures that come to mind are the figures that I saw breaking down according to what the MLR requires, and so the 2014 data that comes to mind is that in 2014, about $116 billion were paid in health care claims in the State of California. There were about $12 billion in administrative expenses reported and profits were about 3%. So I don't know if that helps you answer your question.",0.0
False,,"Yeah. Yep. Payments. But let me verify that, hold on. Yeah, in 2014 it was reported that total plan revenue was $136 billion. A $116 of that went to direct care out on claims.",0.0
False,,The total planned revenue for 2014.,0.0
False,,I don't know the answer to that. I'm sorry. I will have to back and check that.,0.0
False,,I could verify that and touch base with you later.,0.0
False,,"I mean, okay, we'll go with that assumption. I was a poly-sci major for a reason",0.0
False,,"They can be, we don't think it's impossible and we didn't enter-",0.0
False,,"Yeah, I mean we didn't enter our project with any perceived or preconceived notion about possibility, impossibility, inevitability, or other types of concepts that we felt would bog down our work. I think they are possible.",0.0
False,,"The problem is, you know, can you pass the B1, B2 math test? And so, I think that is the real question. If this was a policy or political exercise, it'd be a lot easier to construct something. So, I think, you know, taken with the concept of the various federal requirements, which are hard, and have to be overcome, you know, I wouldn't say that we would, that our principles are incompatible at all.",0.0
False,,"Well, we think about another-",0.0
False,,So the work that we're doing right now will probably yield another 9 to 12 different things to look at.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, and I think when you look at a, you know, potential hit to the commercial markets that totals in the hundreds of millions of dollars, it's hard to find, you know, one policy issue that's going to basically allow a plan to make up that size of a tax hit.",0.0
False,,"And then you also have to consider that, you know, it's not the plans that are paying, it's the employer community, as well. I think that becomes a pretty complex discussion. Obviously, health plans are facing a lot of costs in the healthcare system these days. Rising drug costs is a really big problem in the pricing of drugs.",0.0
False,,"You know, provider consolidation is an issue and particularly the level of outer network activity and those costs that are born in the healthcare system are a problem, as well. So, I mean, sure, there are things to look at, but there's not just one thing that would, you know, total $650 million.",0.0
False,,"But there's certainly some efficiences in the system, you know, that are important to take a look at and then, you know, as we are doing this Committee all the time, or in the regular session version of this Committee all the time, new mandates and legislation raises the cost of healthcare, as well. So, you know, we just wanna be mindful of those things.",0.0
False,,"Well, did you mean the MCO tax?",0.0
False,,"Yeah, I think, well, so let me clarify. You know, the reason we stated that in our letter, we think it's a statement of fact. The Federal Government is allowing states until the end of the respective legislative sessions to solve this.",0.0
False,,"The only thing I would say is, yes, I mean, not having the certainty of revenue, if we are going to rely on this revenue, can be an issue in rate development, not just for the Medi-Cal plans, but for the private market.",0.0
False,,"Ideally if we were going to go in this direction, you'd want to have some certainty about that. I don't think that we would disagree with that notion, but we think more problems are created if we rush through a bad version of this tax.",0.0
False,,"So that's primarily why we feel that some caution needs to be exercised and the time should be used, as much time to think through a workable solution that can garner support from our entire industry.",0.0
False,,"I think the order, yeah",0.0
False,,"Sure, and what we have is our letter, and we do make reference to that in our letter, in the third paragraph.",0.0
False,,To the customers. Yeah.,0.0
False,,"And indeed, CAHP was a strong supporter of the current MCO tax when it was originally passed in, I believe 2009, to help save the healthy families program which was an insurance based program for children that enjoyed bipartisan support in the Legislature.",0.0
False,,"Number two, you don't have to tax enrollment. In other words, there are other units of taxation that could be considered as a part of your construct like revenue as has been discussed.",0.0
False,,"And number three, it quickly dawned upon us that this is more than a policy or political exercise. It's really an exercise in math, if you want to deviate in any way away from the basic perimeters of the federal rules there's certain statistical equations that have to be satisfied particularly on the issue of uniformity which has already been discussed at this hearing.",0.0
False,,"I think it's all plans but I'll have to verify that, yeah.",0.0
False,,"Okay, thanks. Mike Robeson on behalf of the Glass Packaging Institute. Really quickly, appreciate the Select Committee convening. Appreciate the members sitting through the hearing and caring about this issue. I really wanna just quickly concur with some of the remarks that Mark Murray made concerning the bottle bill program.

Expansion of the program to include all containers that are carrying beverages that are already in the program, basically leveling the playing field between container types.",0.0

And to the extent that those students are transferring to a CSU, the state is actually saving money on those units because it's more expensive to educate a student as CSU than at a community college.

False,,"They should also make sure that how they're spending those tax dollars are available through the Public Records Act and because they're here to serve the public should not have conflicts of interest on their board. We do thank Committee staff for the analysis, but would point out charter schools are reimbursed for state mandates.",0.0
False,,Lots of districts use the block grant to get their mandates reimbursed. It's a quick efficient process. We look forward to working with you and urge your support when AB 709 comes off of suspense. Thanks.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association Advocates. Three quick points. I only had two until Mr. Bramble spoke, so I need to add three. The first one in response to what Mr. Bramble said, we do not get mandate reimbursements. School districts can get mandate reimbursements.",0.0
False,,"They cannot get them for charter schools, they can get them for themselves. One of the points that the consultant made in the analysis, which absolutely right on. We don't receive mandate reimbursements, but we do suffer the costs associated with those mandates. It would still be a mandate, we would have to take the money out of the classroom in order to provide the services necessary under this bill.",0.0
False,,"And lastly, I'd just like to point out for the members of the Committee that there is a deal to be had on this bill. We've been dealing with this issue for a very, very long time and it's time to put it to bed. California charter schools actually supports three quarters of the bill.",0.0

False,,More than half of our plans participate in the Medi-Cal managed care program in one form or another. And our plans certainly value the partnership that we have with the Department of Health Care Services. And we agree with the administration that finding a replacement for the existing MCO tax is an important priority. Today our Medi-Cal plans pay the existing iteration of the MCO tax that has been discussed already today.,0.0

False,,"Number two and more relevant to this discussion is that the Federal government as we know has issued guidance suggesting that California's existing MCO tax does not meet Federal parameters. Among other things, our MCO tax must be broadened to all health plans, not just the Medi-Cal plans.",0.0
False,,"And this means that for the first time, individuals and employers paying healthcare coverage in the private markets are now being asked to pay the cost of an MCO tax.

False,,"That can fill the hole in the Medi-Cal budget and garner broad-based health plan support. In December of 2014, our board, CAHP's Board of Directors created a workgroup for plan experts and consultants to determine whether a tax can be constructed that meets certain guiding principles.",0.0
False,,"The principles that define our work are pretty straight forward. We believe that among other things, any new tax must directly benefit the MedipCal program, be equitable to the payers of the tax, and consider affordability to the purchasers of health care coverage. We believe that if you're going to tax people who are doing the right thing in buying coverage, either for themselves or their employees.",0.0
False,,"That the money should go directly back into improving the healthcare system in California. Affordability is also important, because millions of Californians receive coverage through their employer or purchase it on their own. Private purchasers of coverage today are already paying higher taxes due to the imposition of what's called the health insurance tax that was part of the Affordable Care Act.",0.0
False,,"In addition, large purchasers of healthcare coverage are facing the excise tax, commonly referred to as the Cadillac tax, on higher benefit plans, if you will, which kicks in in 2018. So that's on the horizon as a new tax for coverage.",0.0
False,,"So we feel that the health plans, purchasers and policy makers have to be sensitive about adding new taxes to health insurance that will only make it more difficult for people to purchase health coverage. Taxes and fees already represent a pretty significant percentage of the premium dollar.",0.0
False,,"Back to our workgroup and its efforts. Our workgroup organized and then exhausted the first part of 2015, analyzing the administration's January MCO tax proposal. Upon analysis, we recommended to the budget sub committees of the houses to reject the administration's proposal. The proposed tax did not meet the principles that we laid out.",0.0
False,,"And therefore, cannot garner a broad base support within our trade Association and I wanna be sensitive to the difficulties of constructing a new MCO tax and that's not a criticism of the administration. This is very hard work and very complicated work. In any case, soon afterwards CAP, working with our partners at LHPC or the local health plans of California began, really at square one, on developing a better understanding of what the federal Medicaid provider tax rules really say.",0.0
False,,"And identifying areas of flexibility within those rules that might lead to a better result. We learned many interesting things. Number one, you don't have to tax managed care plans under these rules.",0.0
False,,"They're a list of 19 classes of taxable entities that can be considered. Number two, you don't have to tax enrollment and the administration's proposal was enrollment based. But in other words, there are other units of measurement, if you will that can be taxed like revenue and number three that this is more than a policy or a political exercise.",0.0

False,,"But in any case, in order to deviate from the uniformity rules of the federal tax guidance, you must pass a mathematical equation or CMS will not approve any tiered structure, if you will, unless it passes a math test called the B1, B2 test, which is very complicated.

False,,"At this point, we are currently in the middle of that process and project. I think one of my main points that we wanna leave the Committee with is that the task of creating an alternative MCO tax is made difficult by the constraints of the federal guidance.",0.0
False,,"And a solution that meets our goals regrettably has yet to emerge from our efforts. But as I indicated, we are in the middle of a newer process.

Now having said that, that doesn't mean if a solution presents itself earlier than that we shouldn't take that opportunity. But we also shouldn't rush into a bad version of this tax that could be expensive for folks that have to pay for their healthcare.",0.0
False,,"So, I'll leave it at that. And I just wanna close by saying that we're working and this is very complicated business, we look forward to keep our connections with the administration and we've had several positive conversations with them and this Committee as our work moves forward. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Yeah. I mean, there's nothing inherently, how do I wanna say this? There's nothing inherently wrong with any construct of the tax, but they do contain certain tendencies, I guess. So you could do something that's a flat tax, which is something that's being proposed in the Legislature.",0.0
False,,"What we found in examining that structure is that there's a tradeoff on affordability vis-a-vis the commercial markets. In order to raise the same amount of revenue, you would have to increase the burden of the tax on the commercial markets in order to achieve the same amount of revenue is what we found in our analysis.",0.0
False,,"And really the reason for that is one of the theories behind the administrations proposal, a tiered tax was that if they created the tiers in a certain manner. I think what they were trying to do is place all of the MediCal plans in the highest tax tier, so that you could really leverage and maximize the federal dollars that you could obtain from CMS.",0.0
False,,"And the MediCal plans, because they're paid on an actuarial basis. See those costs reflected in the reimbursement rates from the state. So having them here and a particular commercial plan here is not necessarily a problem.",0.0
False,,"But if you flatten the tax, you have to move the commercial plans up here. And so that means you have to raise more money from the private markets in order to raise the same amount of revenue. So that's a tradeoff and the tradeoff with the tiered tax is though, although you might wanna try to leverage more federal dollars out of the Medicaid plans just by basis of a plan's enrollment size.",0.0
False,,"A problem that we saw with the administrations proposals is that we have a handful of mid-sized commercial plans that have absolutely no MediCal business, but by virtue of enrollment. They were placed in the highest tax tier. So that means, and they're competing in the same markets as these larger plans, so that is an inherent problem in that structure.",0.0
False,,"So, is there a way to resolve those issues? We're trying, what I do wanna emphasize again is that this isn't a political exercise, a mathematical exercise. You can vary from the federal rules, but you can only do so, if you meet certain statistical tests. And if you don't, they'll reject the tax.",0.0

False,,"Can range anywhere from $0.75 per member per month to $25.25 per member per month. So, obviously, we're a family of five in my house, so if our premiums went up $25 per person, that's $125, potentially.",0.0
False,,"In increased premiums, and you can extrapolate that out through further years. So that gives you an idea. I mean, the only other thing I'll say, Mister Chair, is that these types of taxes and fees are reflected currently in the premiums.",0.0
False,,"It's very difficult to absorb the entire cost of this within the plan, especially since one proposal actually doubles one of my plans' entire obligation to the state. They can't just write that off, so it's an affordability issue.",0.0
False,,I think when you look at aggregate costs. You know the $650 million that would result as a part of the January proposal is significant.

False,,"We really wanna see what's possible. And we don't think that achieving those goals is impossible within the federal guidelines, as long as you're meeting the mathematical tests. But on the specific elements, affordability is a big one, since people have to afford to buy our coverage.",0.0
False,,And the goal there is really to minimize the impact on the commercial markets as much as possible. And then I think the employer community and the plans are going to have to determine whether any cost is worth the purported benefits of the tax.,0.0
False,,"Right, there are many states that are wrestling with this issue Just by way of example, we've been in touch with the Michigan Association of Health Plans and our counterparts in Pennsylvania, those are two states that are wrestling with this question, interestingly enough, their legislators are petitioning CMS to continue their existing MCO taxes.",0.0
False,,"It'll be interesting to see how successful those efforts are. One state, Michigan for example, tried an MCO tax based on claims data. They have a fundamentally different private market than we do in California.",0.0
False,,"Ours is more capitated where the plans pay a per member, per month capitated rate to the medical groups. That take on the risk. Risk is not allowed, risk is only allowed for the health plans' security not the providers' so they're more of a fee per service claims based market so that works for them.",0.0

False,,"So during the first round we, as Chairman Chau started, we awarded approximately $63 million to 17 projects. These included one project that will be operated as transitional housing. Three that will serve the general veteran population and 13 projects that have VHHP supported housing. Along with other general veteran and non-VHHP funded units. This investment will support the creation of a total of 1,222 total affordable housing units of which 566 will be VHHP assisted.",0.0
False,,"Per statute as Ms. Gunn stated before, 50% of the funds must be used to produce housing for extremely low income populations or ELI populations and of that no less than 60% is required to be supportive housing. During the first round we well exceeded these targets that are set out by law.",0.0
False,,"Of the 566 VHHP units 72% were dedicated to ELI populations, so 50% the requirement, we got to 72% and that equates to 359 ELI homes, 371 are supportive housing. So, we actually exceeded, by 100%, the number of supportive housing that is required by law. 146 of the supportive housing units and all 23 transitional housing units are provided to assist chronically homeless veterans.",0.0

False,,It may not go into quite this level of detail but I can certainly repeat anything.,0.0
False,,"So in order to ensure that we're able to meet and exceed the targets set out in law to provide service enriched housing for the most vulnerable through permanent supportive housing, we have intentionally structured the funding guidelines for the first and second round to prioritize the housing needs of this population, while still providing some flexibility to also serve higher income populations and those with less acute service needs. So we've really front loaded the first couple of rounds to ensure that we're meeting the targets. 32 total application were received requesting approximately $125 million.",0.0
False,,"Given the demand for the program in the first round, we were asked to address the barriers in awarding the total $75 million in funding this round. So I'll speak to that for just a moment. The barriers really are the result of the unique and new characteristics of the program. Obviously, we went from zero to program guidelines in a very short period of time.",0.0
False,,"In order to tailor a project to meet the guideline requirements, folks really needed more time to kind of assess the project, and get the partnerships in place, that the guidelines required. Not to mention the complexity of some of the partnerships that needed to be created, and the relationships that needed to be created between the service providers and the housing developers that are in some cases, non-traditional.",0.0
False,,"We actually did extensive outreach, stakeholder outreach, before the first round, and we actually did hear from a lot of potential applicants as well as actual applicants that they didn't anticipate either applying this round or they knew that they weren't gonna be competitive this round, but they were gonna apply anyway. And so ultimately, some of the folks that did apply that were in that category of really not thinking they would be competitive, really just wanted to cut a test their projects against it. And ultimately, we after scoring the projects, we felt we really did come up with a set of 17 projects that were exemplary in terms of providing the type of housing and the type of services that we really wanted to see.",0.0
False,,"We would anticipate though going forward, as people have the opportunity as the project sponsors have the opportunity to really strengthen the partnerships to really familiarize themselves with the guidelines and to tailor their projects for what the guidelines are asking for that we'll see fuller utilization of the funds.",0.0
False,,"Let me just speak to quickly another factor there. All but one unsuccessful applicant lost substantial points in the category that had to do with the rental and operating subsidies, as has been mentioned. This is one of the places where there is a challenge. Other areas where scores tended to be low or the quality of supportive service plans, project readiness, and the experience of the lead service provider and so those were some other areas where folks lost a substantial number of points.",0.0
False,,"So now I'll move to If there aren't any questions with that data, I'll move to the geographic distribution. The guidelines lay out very specific geographic targets based upon where we see the highest concentrations of need for the states most vulnerable veterans. That's LA, the Bay Area, Orange County and San Diego. And so, of the 32 applications received, we saw a substantial number coming from the LA area. Really fewer than anticipated from the San Francisco Bay Area and San Diego. And so I think, kind of, the lesson Learned around that is we really would like to increase our outreach and future rounds to ensure that projects are ready and coming forward in all of those areas to ensure that we're targeting all of the places where we have concentrations of populations that need assistance.",0.0
False,,"In terms of kind of the funding mix, all projects except one rely on low income housing tax credits. It's obviously a very critical source of funding, especially where we're targeting for extremely low income populations. As I mentioned previously funding for services will continue, but will likely continue to be a challenge for the forseeable future. And the first round the services were being provided from a wide variety of sources including HUD's, Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program, or VASH Program, the supportive services for veteran's families funding, which is S-S-V-F program from the VA, as well as other VA programs, project operating income, the LA County Department of Health Services. And then many service providers are also providing in-kind services, as part of the project.",0.0
False,,"In addition of those project that were awarded, eight projects have external rental or operating subsidies. Again, VASH is part of that and to Chair Woman Erwin's question, four projects had VASH vouchers committed for a total of 183 VASH vouchers that were committed for the program.",0.0
False,,"And we are working very, very closely with our partners in the Federal Government, HUD and VA to help align those resources to ensure the program can provide the level of services and operations that we hope to have. So let me turn just for a moment to lessons learned.",0.0
False,,"As I mentioned, we conducted extensive stakeholder outreach when we were developing the program guidelines, as well as extensive listening and feedback after the first NOFA and awards were made. I think what we concluded is we have a great mix of successes and lessons that we're building on in the second round, and in subsequent rounds.",0.0
False,,"Obviously a success is that we conceived and developed a program in less than a year, and got $63 million out the door, and are providing much needed housing for veterans. Nearly 12,000 units, 566 for veterans. So that is something, certainly, to be proud of.",0.0
False,,"We, in setting, in trying to meet the goals set out in statute in terms of meeting the needs of ELI households and veterans, as well as the permanent support of Housing, we well exceeded those goals, as I mentioned, and so that's a great success, and we're really proud of that accomplishment and happy we're able to exceed that.",0.0
False,,"And then I think based upon the feedback in the lessons learned sessions, we really are making relatively minor changes going into the second round in the hopes that folks are able to adapt projects that have been in the pipeline. And, as I mentioned, strengthen the relationships between the service providers and the housing development sponsors in order to bring forward more projects so that we make sure that we get the full 75 million out this round. In terms of lessons, certainly in any circumstance, new partnerships and collaboration are hard.",0.0
False,,"We come with our own lenses, marrying different cultures, and so this is really a process of expanding our knowledge base, learning about one another's cultures and building on that technical expertise and the perspectives that we both bring to the table. And so that is a lesson and I think part of it stepping back and just taking the time to listen to one another and to understand where each stakeholder is coming from.",0.0
False,,"We heard the need for an improved and clarified and streamlined application process and hopefully that is reflected in the new guidelines that came out this week. As I mentioned before, we did see that we need to have improved outreach in the Bay Area and San Diego in the next round, so we make sure we have better representation in those areas. And then as been mentioned several times, funding for services is going to continue to be a challenge and so we're just gonna have to get very creative there. Finally, as Ms. Gunn mentioned, we really need to continue to grow the competency in serving veterans and understanding the unique culture around the service provision and housing needs. So turning to the round two NOFA and guidelines, this week the second round of guidelines were released. We anticipate that the awards from this round will be made in June of next year.",0.0
False,,"Over the next month, we'll actually be hosting five guideline workshops, one of which will be a webinar. So this will be around the state, but then also one will be a webinar, so it's accessible to folks from around the state. We really have made very minor amendments to the first rung guidelines focusing primarily on clarifying and streamlining the application process as well as providing some best practices in the guidelines.",0.0
False,,"So where do we go from here? We anticipate that we'll continue to make $75 million available until the funding runs out. We anticipate that will be about seven or eight funding cycles. Our goal is to provide housing for 7,000 veterans and veteran family members. We hope to produce 4,900 units specifically for veterans experiencing homelessness, of which about 2,800 to 3,300 of those would be permanent, supportive housing for homeless veterans.",0.0
False,,"And obviously the outcome of all of this will hopefully be that in the State of California, we'll see significantly less veteran homelessness and in the coming decade. We'll continue to monitor the implementation of phase one and learn as those programs are put into service. We are in the midst of developing rigorous evaluation process evidenced by AB-388 to monitor the improvements of the veteran housing conditions, income, health, outcomes.",0.0
False,,"All of the significant factors that demonstrate the success of the program and in doing this we're involving UC Davis's Institute for population health improvement to assist with the evaluation protocols for the program. So I will conclude there, and thank you again for hosting and providing the leadership and hosting the hearing today. And I'll turn it over to Tia Patterson.",0.0
False,,"Yes, so 1,221 affordable housing units total, of which 566 units were being VHHP assisted. So in some cases we would have an affordable housing development that wouldn't be 100% for vets, or may have some mix of supportive housing. Different income levels. And so it could be a mix. But not necessarily 100% VHHP supported.",0.0
False,,"So generally in an affordable housing development there's a funding gap that exists, and it will be that funding gap is typically filled by a number of different funding sources. And so I mentioned that the vast majority of the projects had low income housing tax credits in there. And so low income tax credits aren't limited to veterans,",0.0
False,,"It can house a range of different populations and so there might be low income tax credits. It could be multi family housing program, as well as VHHP and so those funding sources were layered together in order to create, a larger number of affordable housing units, of which 566 were supported by and restricted to house veterans under this program. Does that help?",0.0
False,,"I'll just add onto Tia's comments. A lot of this really reflects the funding silos that we've really established, federal, state, local. Local, both at the county level, the city level, as well as among public policy areas. Often times, we'll line those up, but really is not, it's a conscious after the fact, but not necessarily up front trying to align our guidelines, align the programmatic pieces, along government and public policy silos. So it really is a reflection of that and so when enter into these collaborations, the reason it's messy is we're not accustomed to speaking each other's language, we don't use the same lens.",0.0
False,,"And so I think that's part of this process and the beauty of this program is that we really are pushing ourselves to align, to think a long the same lines, to try and speak the same language, to decode some of the things. I think anyone who is around affordable housing very long understands that we have lots of acronyms and we have our own language and I think that would go for, certainly the services area as well and so I think it really is a reflection of the way that we've funded your different aspects of public policy.",0.0
False,,"It is not necessarily typical, but from the perspective of where we were seeing similar demographics and concentrations, it made sense in the context of this particular program. But it is not necessarily what we do across programs.",0.0
False,,"So we're working really, really closely with our federal partners right now, and accessing as many resources as possible to align with the program. They understand the fact that we really stepped up as a state to try and address the problem of veteran homelessness. And so they're very willing participants and are engaging in really productive conversations about how we can bring more VASH vouchers to the state, SSVF funding, those types of resources in order to support the program, cuz they understand that the gap exists.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, well it's absolutely right. These are projects that we'll be breaking ground in the next few months to the next year maybe even longer. I think one of the things that I do want to emphasize in the second rounds is readiness, ensuring that the projects are as close as possible to breaking ground and being put into services possible. But in terms of tracking the success, I mean obviously we won't know the success until they've been placed into service and we can begin to collect the data that we spoke about today. Yeah, we do.",0.0
False,,I don't think we have a specific time on any of them yet.,0.0
False,,"There were really a variety of reasons. I mentioned, really because of the time in which applications had to prepare and submit applications and the novelty of the program the partnerships weren't necessarily in place. The projects weren't necessarily designed for these populations and didn't really meet the criteria that we had put out in the guidelines.",0.0
False,,"And obviously the development sponsors are planning for their projects 18 months, 24 months, 36 months even in advance. And so when a funding source comes in kind of late in the pipe line, it's really difficult to kind of back track and change the design, change the features, change the types of units, the unit mix, those types of things.",0.0
False,,"And then really as I spoke to earlier I mean the silos that we've kind of lived in between service providers and housing development sponsors, has really, with MHSA, with MHP, supportive housing, those types of things, has been growing. But really this particular program brings it to a whole new level.",0.0
False,,"And so really giving developers and service providers the time to strengthen those partnerships to align the service provision and the development, takes a little bit more time. So I think that's probably a primary factor is really just the time frames.",0.0
False,,"But beyond the applications that actually went through scoring and were competitive but did lose points on a variety of categories. Not really any particular cause we could point to but as I mentioned earlier, the places where folks tended to lose a significant amount of points that seem to contribute to being less competitive was the quality of the supportive services plan. And one of the kind of lessons Learned for us was really clarifying exactly what we were looking for there. So were providing some more clarity in the second round and make sure that folks know exactly what it is that we're looking for.",0.0
False,,"Project readiness, and this was something because we did want to kind of create some time frames so that we can bring units on-line quickly. And so folks may not have been far enough along. May not have secured all the resources necessary to break ground and to move forward with constructing the project and then the experience of the lead service provider. So those were the areas that we saw.",0.0
False,,"Very similar set of circumstances really. Readiness, the level of relationships, how far along the projects were in terms of moving down the pipeline in terms of their design and the features of the development.",0.0
False,,And really just not being ready with the level of service plan that we're looking for in order to meet the needs of the populations that we're trying to house.,0.0
False,,566 units.,0.0
False,,And their family members.,0.0
False,,"If I can just add, I think we can't get there if we don't know where we're going. We can't do that without data, and so that's part of this, is how do we really set the policies and show that we're moving the needle broadly on housing our veterans and ensuring that we're getting them off the streets, if we're not tracking that data? And so I think that's one piece and the best place to do that is to really kind of reach down into the continuum of cares and make sure that they're consistently tracking data and that we are able to kind of tap into that and to help integrate that.",0.0
False,,"But I think the other piece, too, one of the reasons that HUD really pushed in this direction was that they were finding that individuals, many of which are likely chronically homeless veterans, were cycling through the system.",0.0
False,,"So we're talking, to some extent, about big picture today, looking at aggregate data. But the reality is what folks were seeing, that were down in the trenches trying to ensure that folks were really getting assisted and stabilized and getting off the streets, was that a single individual would cycle through social service providers, shelters, transitional housing, multiple, multiple times and no one was tracking that.",0.0
False,,"And so one social service provider would see them over here and then the next week they would be over here. So we have no idea whether or not that person is being appropriately housed and stabilized and so that's another function. Its really the human face of what all of this data means is that in order to track it in the aggregate that we're ensuring that that one individual that is jumping from social service provider to different housing, transitional housing shelters.",0.0
False,,That that individual is getting off the streets and stabilized and their underlying conditions are being addressed.,0.0
False,,"As close as possible. I mean, obviously what we wanna do is deploy this money as quickly as possible, as effectively as possible, bring quality projects online so that we can get folks off the streets as quickly as possible and appropriately house veterans as quickly as possible. So ideally readiness really needs to be a factor so that way our money isn't just sitting there, but it's being invested to very quickly ensure that we're making an impact.",0.0

I wanted to thank you all for the very serious conversation that was had today and to echo some comments made by previous speakers specifically with regards to public transit.",0.0
False,,"As this transportation funding package comes together, we wish to remind you to also consider the needs of public transit, which, of course, serves to increase mobility options and improve environmental objectives that the state is striving to achieve. To that end, we think that the governor's proposal to advance $400 million annually for public transit makes good sense.",0.0

False,,"Not only just legislatively, but also through the budget process. How do we get the resources down to the communities so that we can eliminate and ultimately abolish this heinous action that's going on in our state? And so, I'm extremely excited because I think this will be the first,",0.0
False,,"at least from the State of California, this will be the first effort to look at a long range in a comprehensive way that we can deal with this. Human trafficking hit us like nothing else before. I think the last time we've had this kind of emergency was when we had the crack cocaine epidemic.",0.0
False,,"It just was like a tsunami that overtook us. Law enforcement has said that they need more resources, and sometimes they don't even know what they need. And so I'm welcoming not only ideas that we're doing in the state, but out of state. Because, this is not only a local issue, a state issue, it's become a national,",0.0

False,,"I think not. I also think that, again just to help clear this up, for other mandated reporters what needs reported, what doesn't and to clear it up so kids can feel safe to be able to share when they go seek help for something that's troubling them.

False,,"Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I'm pleased today to present AB 830 the bill that makes clear that all Californians, including transgender women and men, are afforded the same protections against violence or threats of violence based on gender. We've all heard sobering statistics of women being victims of stalking, threats, or violence.",0.0
False,,"However, these problems are particularly pronounced when we're talking about the transgender community and they currently are not afforded the same protections under law as others. This bill makes it so that the people are able to be able to have protections under the law as well they should if they are victims of violence and-or assault. There's no opposition.

This bill will prevent individuals and corporations with the history of non-compliance with opening new facilities in the state by asking the department social services to cross-reference these and by establishing further to their website where people can be able to go on the Department of Social Services website and see what people have owned, what allegations they've had against them, what things have they been out of compliance, and make good decisions about where their loved ones go in their final years of life. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",0.0

False,,"Chairman Bell and Chairman Nielson and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to address you today. This is an important program. HCD is proud to be in partnership with CalVet and CalHFA in implementing a program that allows us to support finding stable and affordable housing to California's veterans.",0.0
False,,"My testimony today will first focus on a broad set of principals that have guided the three implementing departments in the design of the program. I'll then share highlights Learned from round one from the program and then I'll close with some statistics from the applications received from round two. In order to minimise the length and complexity of the presentation, we've provided a number of handouts Tricia has already alluded to you. That should be in front of you by now and throughout the presentation I'll refer by number to those hand outs.",0.0
False,,"So let me start with principle number one. By design the VHHP program seeks to flexibly address a wide range of housing and service needs for our state's diverse veteran population. The program recognizes California's veteran population as neither a single monolithic group nor homogenous group. As such, the program allows project sponsors to design projects that address a variety of demographic and social needs within the larger veteran population.",0.0
False,,"So let me give you just a couple examples of these diverse needs. Veterans age 55 and older are making up a larger cohort of the veteran population and increasingly these veterans will need housing and supportive housing services to help them stay in their homes and communities as both by virtue of the fact that they're aging, as well as their special needs as being veterans. Homeless veterans tend to be older than the non-veteran homeless, making the need to assist aging veterans a growing imperative.",0.0
False,,"A second demographic is the needs of the post-9/11 veterans. These are unique, as they face employment and economic challenges as they transition to civilian life. The median age of the post 9/11 veterans is 29 years old, and the group is far more diverse, both in gender and ethnicity, than veterans coming from prior conflicts.",0.0
False,,Many of those that have recently transitioned to civilian life encountered extraordinary challenges in translating their military experience into stable employment opportunities at a time when the economy was weak and unemployment was high. These difficulties have often been compounded by the fact that housing affordability challenges are the greatest in the places where job opportunities exist.,0.0
False,,"A third demographic group that we're particularly focused on at this time is a rapidly growing demographic with families with children and specifically female veterans with children. Female veterans are a growing share of the veteran population. They currently make up about 9% of the veteran population in California, and that percentage is expected to rise dramatically in future years. Female veterans have increased risk for homelessness when compared to non-veteran females. 50% of single veteran mothers are housing cost burdened compared to 25% of all veterans.",0.0
False,,"In addition, service related post traumatic stress disorders, military sexual trauma are also risk factors in housing instability. Turning to principal number two this is that communities also need to address their needs based upon their diverse needs. So for example local demographics, access to resource, cost of housing, cost of development, are all factors that have to be taken into consideration as local communities seek to address their veteran housing and services needs.",0.0
False,,"Recognizing that one size does not fit all, the VHHP seeks to provide communities flexibility in serving their local needs while ensuring that Statewide legislative objectives are being met. A few ways in which this is accomplished is through flexibility in the project type. VHHP provides flexibility in how development and services are funded. VHHP prioritizes supportive housing as required by Proposition 41, but also allows funding of other critical housing types including family housing and transitional housing.",0.0
False,,"In addition, we provide flexibility through the population served. VHHP prioritizes support of housing for the most vulnerable Veteran populations. But there's also flexibility to mix populations within a particular project, both Vet and non-Vet populations, or to serve other special needs sub-populations, as well as the general veteran population with in a project. However I want to emphasize that VHHP funding is only invested in those units that are actually housing veteran population in compliance with the statute.",0.0
False,,"The third principal is that supportive housing provided through VHHP serves and seeks to stabilize the most vulnerable veterans experiencing homelessness. VHHP financial systems are structured specifically to provide deeper financial systems when this population is being served. And given the lack of upgrading income from the residents, additional operating services funding outside the project cash flow is also necessary for ongoing financial viability and services. This is a theme, obviously you'll hear quite a bit today.",0.0
False,,"To insure delivery of quality services and more successful outcomes for residents, VHHP projects require lead service providers who are experienced in providing veterans-centric and housing-first oriented services. And in addition, VHHP requires intensive, on-site case managers to provide services tailored to each veteran's needs, with an emphasis on service, revision that is flexible, voluntary, and easily accessible.",0.0
False,,"Principle number four is that VHHP investments should be made in a way that maximize the ability to leverage and integrate with other community investments to address veteran homelessness and housing instability. For example, we incentivize commitments from the HUD-VASH program, the Housing Choice voucher and other creative ways to provide operational stability such as local subsidies.",0.0
False,,"To ensure the most pressing community needs are being served and that projects are integrated into the overall community strategies, we reward projects that collaborate with the local continuum of care, the VA offices on the local level, as well as other local level efforts.",0.0
False,,"A fifth principle is that VHHP investments should reflect where veterans with the highest needs actually live. Through the program guidelines, we've established geographic targets based upon where we see concentrations of homeless veterans and extremely low income renters that have severe cost burdens. We're going to continue to re evaluate these geographic targets as new data comes available, to ensure that our investments are actually accurately reflect the most dire needs.",0.0
False,,"And then finally, and this will be part of Tia's testimony as well, I'll just briefly touch on a significant principal is that we are all as the implementing departments Significantly committed to ongoing and deep stakeholder engagement and feedback, evaluation of the program and individual outcomes in making continuous improvements through the program.",0.0
False,,"All right, so I'll now turn to round one outcomes and the lessons Learned there. I'm gonna refer you to handout number four, that provides some more in-depth information, but I'm just gonna highlight a couple of the key issues today. It is called handout number four, February 2015, funding round one outcomes. Got it? Okay, great.",0.0
False,,"Okay, so while the program establishes a high set of standards for the type of housing and services required. Applicants are successfully meeting the requirements, this is one of the lessons we're learning. 13 of the 17 funded projects in round one incorporate supportive housing and 66% of the housing units funded by VHHP are supportive housing. Projects were structured during round one to, or those awarded during round one, were structured to allow a diversity of populations to be served, including veteran families and seniors.",0.0
False,,"Nine projects will contain two bedroom units, representing 24% of the VHHP funded units, having two or more bedrooms so that accommodates the veterans with families. In addition three projects will serve senior veterans. Given feedback from round one we also know that there's an interest in serving female veterans, especially those with histories of military sexual trauma or domestic violence. The design of the project would likely require special safety and security considerations as well as specialized services.",0.0
False,,"We also know that there may be some fair housing issues here that could present challenges to offer single gender housing. However, with CalVet's leadership on this topic we're exploring ways in which VHHP can serve this important population. A second lesson is that both communities and applicants are really pulling together to ensure the highest quality of housing and services related to the VHHP funded projects.",0.0
False,,"I'm gonna now refer you to handout number three and this one is entitled Typical Service Models in Support of Housing. And so we'll focus first on page one. We know that with the years of experience in administering MHP supportive housing program, as well are experience in the first VHHP round, that there's no one services model or single way to fund services But in general, services and support of housing comprised of mixed of federal state and local resources.",0.0
False,,"In the case of round one, of the 13 supportive housing projects, 8 have external rental subsidies including 4 from HUD-VASH, which also includes funding for case management. On site individual case management is typically paid for through cash flow, grant sources, or VASH. Some projects are also using Continuum of Care or Supportive Services for Veteran Families, a program which is also known as SSVF or Case Management Services.",0.0
False,,"Another creative way that project sponsors are using is to provide additional financial support for the projects is to actually mix incomes in the project. This structure allows additional cashflow that can be used to fund services for those sort of housing units. To meet the diverse needs of residents, case management must connect to the widest array of mainstream community-based services as possible, such as healthcare, mental health, employment, education, substance abuse services, and income supports.",0.0
False,,"Sometimes these services are co-located and visible within the particular development, but also, they may be just accessible within the community and be provided through the intensive case management. The funding streams for these community-based services are diverse and include county mental health services, including those provided through specialty mental health services funded by MediCal, and through the MHSA program.",0.0
False,,"Some of these community based services are targeted specifically to veterans, such as employment or benefits advocacy, and some are available to the general population. And so on that page one of handout three, you'll see that there's four kind of general areas where services are being provided, either directly to veterans, or to the general population. Either through the Affordable Care Act, through general localized services, or through the VA. For residents who qualify for VA services, connections are also made to VA services that include physical health, mental health, and substance abuse services, as well as employment services.",0.0
False,,"This rich federal resource is an additional asset to qualifying VHHP residents. And a new resource that I just alluded to, through the Affordable Care Act in California's Medicaid expansion, provides single tenants now qualifying for healthcare services funded by MediCal. We anticipate increased flexibility in delivering eligible services in housing under California's proposed 1115 Medicaid waiver, which was just approved by the federal government. And the health homes option currently under development by the Department of Healthcare Services.",0.0
False,,"So, finally, it's worth noting here that VHHP service requirements are generally set at a higher standard than other supportive housing programs. The general requirements are highlighted on page two of that same handout that you're looking at right now, handout three on page two. And so this is gonna kind of walk you through some of the minimum service requirements, as well as some of those that are augmented services.",0.0
False,,"So key requirements include higher standards for lead service provider experience. So to ensure a delivery of quality services VHHP projects require lead service providers with experience in providing better eccentric and housing first oriented services. There's a requirement for minimum service requirements that have also been established. In addition, we expect the use of evidence based service practices by the service providers such as, trauma informed care or motivational interviewing. Weve established lower case management ratios and higher level of required credentials for case managers. VHHP requires intensive onsite managers with appropriate staff tenant ratios using qualified leave service provider staff. In addition, services must be tailored to each veteran's needs, so really, customized and individualized service plans. We expect that the case management will bring strong connections to both the VA and community based services. Including primary care and county behavioral health services, whether provided on-site or accessible generally within the community.",0.0
False,,"Finally, in wrapping up the lessons learned, we did see that some areas of the state did not have projects where we had targeted some needs. And based upon our round two applications we do anticipate that we're gonna be closer to meeting those targets in round two.",0.0
False,,"And then lastly we just wanted to acknowledge that a significant number of projects were not funded in the first round and provide a little bit of background on this. We attribute this primarily to really the tight time frames and meeting new and more complex requirements in rating, has already been alluded to. There was a very short time frame in which for folks to get their projects ready and to conform to a new rating and ranking system and the new requirements. In fact, many of the applications or several of the applications that came in actually self scored below our minimum scoring requirements. And so they were aware in applying that they would not be funded.",0.0
False,,"Finally, the target population is difficult to serve. As it takes significant subsidies to complete these projects, they require operating rental subsidies outside of what a normal on supportive housing project would require, so in order to garner that financial support, it needed a little bit more time. So we do anticipate that in round two that we're going to see that turn around.",0.0
False,,"So now, let me now turn to round two. Following the first round, the state agencies held three public meeting to solicit feedback, in Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, with video conferencing available in a number of cities as well. Feedback on the basic program design was mostly positive all though there was a fair amount of criticism of the application process both in terms of the complexity of the forms and the way in which the supportive services were scored.",0.0
False,,"In addition, the state agencies conducted four in person application workshops for the second round in Oakland, Riverside, San Diego, and Los Angeles, as well as one application workshop that was web based. As a result of the feedback that we received, we made minor amendments to the round one guidelines, focusing primarily on clarifying and streamlining the application process.",0.0
False,,"And you can see a summary of specific changes that were made in the handout number six in your packet. In some, the application scoring was simplified as I mentioned and made more transparent. In connection with this change, the scoring advantage for supportive housing was increased. We clarified that case management is eligible operating expenses, along with resident services coordination.",0.0
False,,"The scoring for rental subsidies now gives credit to projects that can deliver very low rents without the need for external rent, or operating subsidies. And then finally we added a section, on non-mandatory best practices in design and property management that focuses on resident's safety. In terms of the round two applications, you can find a summary of that information in handout number five.",0.0
False,,"In mid-December 2015, we received 34 applications, representing $180 million in requests for what we have now, which is $75 million to allocate. Although we're at the early stages of a review, we've provided a preliminary data sheet for your reference as I mentioned in handout number five.",0.0
False,,"In general, this round of applications is more consistent with the program's geographic targeting, as I mentioned, with increased participation from San Diego and the Bay Area, where we saw fewer applications than we would have liked to have seen in the first round. We also see an increased use of VASH and project base housing twist vouchers and continue to see a majority of VHHP units as supportive housing units that are deeply targeted to disabled veterans experiencing chronic homelessness or other types of homelessness.",0.0
False,,We also see mixed income housing and housing projects proposed for veteran families and senior veterans at a higher rate. These preliminary figures seem to indicate strong demand for the program and are very consistent with the principles that articulated earlier in my remarks. There's a participation from a wide geography and a willingness to more deeply target the most vulnerable veterans to provide supportive services.,0.0
False,,"As next steps, we'll be providing preliminary scoring feedback to applicants in February with final awards to be made in spring of 2016. So before I close and turn it over to Tia, I just wanted to take the opportunity to say thank you to all of those who have been instrumental in creating the VHHP program. First and foremost, are the members of the Legislature who are you're vision and commitment to ensuring the success of the program, both in it's design and it's ongoing evaluation.",0.0
False,,"In addition both CAPSA and corporations for support of housing deserve a dab of gratitude for their leadership in sponsoring AB39. In addition, the program stakeholders and our key partners in federal, state, and local governments are really key to the successful implementation of the program as well as the on going evaluation ff the program to ensure that we can continue to successfully fund projects to serve our most dire veteran housing and services needs. With that I will close and turn it over Diane. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,Good afternoon. Thank you for inviting me here today. I'm Sharon Rapport.,0.0
False,,I'm with the Corporation for Supportive Housing. CSH is a national non profit and community development financial institution working to end homelessness.,0.0
False,,"We offer loans and grants, technical assistance, systems change, and research around models of housing and services for highly vulnerable populations, including veterans.",0.0
False,,"CSH was a cosponsor of Assembly Bill 639, and we did work on passing Proposition 41. First, I'd like to congratulate the Legislature and Governor for passing what is a landmark legislation for creating rental housing projects for Veterans and their families.",0.0
False,,"And, I'd also like to thank the three state departments for putting together thoughtful guidelines and for welcoming stakeholder feedback. And I think they have listened very thoughtfully to that stakeholder feedback.",0.0
False,,"We support the guidelines as a whole. The guidelines prioritize supportive housing, and we do think this initial prioritization of supportive housing makes a lot of sense.",0.0
False,,"Though we do support the need for more affordable housing for veterans who are just becoming homeless or who are risk of homelessness, an initial prioritization for supportive housing makes sense, given that veterans are more vulnerable to becoming homeless and are far more likely to be chronically homeless than other people who fall into homelessness.",0.0
False,,The priority is basic to achieving the initial goals of VHHP and reducing or eliminating homelessness among veterans in California. The guidelines also endorse Housing First Approach and I know several people have mentioned that. I just wanted to explain a little bit more of what that means.,0.0
False,,"Housing First is an evidence based model that recognizes that ending homelessness begins with offering homeless veterans a safe, decent place to live before services can be effective.",0.0
False,,And that place to live should be an independent apartment that has no limit on the length of how long that veteran and their family could live there.,0.0
False,,"Housing First reduces barriers highly vulnerable veterans have in getting healthy, while significantly decreasing the risk of a veteran's return to homelessness.",0.0
False,,"This approach aligns VHHP with federal policies recognized in the VA's Supportive Housing Program, and other U.S. veteran's programs, as well as HUD programs.",0.0
False,,"It also aligns with studies that show the effectiveness of permanent housing in reducing returns to homelessness. Housing First, however, is not housing only. And the guidelines balance the need for quality evidence based services that worked in the veteran's long term experience with homelessness.",0.0
False,,Research shows services offered voluntarily at housing are effective in moving veterans who've experienced long term homelessness into housing stability.,0.0
False,,"And these services include client centered case management, which we think is essential for anybody who has experienced long term homelessness, but particularly for veterans.",0.0
False,,"And again, this is tenant centered, using motivational interviewing and a harm reduction strategy that engages veterans who are otherwise highly distrustful of health care and veteran systems.",0.0
False,,"Care coordination that links veterans to medical mental health and evidence based substance use treatment services, as well as services that may be available to them as veterans.",0.0
False,,"Training on life skills, money management and basic tenancy for veterans, some of whom have been homeless for decades.

These are the core services that are shown to reduce returns to homelessness and stabilize veterans in housing.",0.0
False,,"CSH has worked for over a decade to secure a sustainable source of services funding and housing in California, and unfortunately we have not yet succeeded. So we know that services funding is one barrier to creating more supportive housing units in this state.",0.0
False,,"However, we did prepare, in preparation for VHHP, we did convene a work group to identify existing services funding, and the work group identified several funding sources. So at the risk of repeating some of what Ms. Riggs offered in her testimony, I'm just gonna explain some of these services funding sources.",0.0
False,,"In some counties, the VA contracts with local, non profit service providers to provide case management services to veterans through the HUD VASH program. We're hoping that the VA expands this community based provider model to all VA medical centers in California.",0.0
False,,"In addition to VASH, the VA funds also the Homeless Patient Aligned Care Teams, which provide and coordinate healthcare veterans may need, Healthcare for Homeless Veterans, which offers outreach and case management services to chronically homeless veterans, and Supportive Services for Veteran's Families, or SSVF, which Ms. Riggs mentioned.",0.0
False,,"And that is available, that program is available to veterans with other than honorable discharge status. SSVF can be used to provide intensive, year long, critical time intervention services to veterans.",0.0
False,,"For those who are not eligible for VA health care benefits or don't have access to SSVF which is not available in all counties in California, many housing providers cobble together operating revenue and philanthropic or private funding to fund services, and I think that's been mentioned here today, as well.",0.0

PATH funds services to people with serious mental illness, including those with co occuring substances disorders who are experiencing homelessness or are at eminent risk of becoming homeless.",0.0
False,,You've heard today about Proposition 63 or the Mental Health Services Act. We actually think historically this program has been underused by veterans. But we are seeing an increase in how many veterans are served through the Proposition 63 program.,0.0
False,,"This program funds full service partnerships to residents with serious mental illness, including low staff to client ratios, 24/7 crisis availability, and client centered approaches to recovery.",0.0
False,,"And then finally, some counties, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, are beginning to fund services through their health dollars for homeless people who have frequently used county hospital services. And a good number of veterans are being assisted with this program.",0.0
False,,"In addition to these current resources, CSH has been working with our partners, including HCD, to create new health home benefit to fund services for chronically ill Medi-Cal beneficiaries, and we know a good number of veterans, more than people realize, are Medi-Cal beneficiaries.",0.0
False,,"We expect this benefit will fund a significant range of services and supportive housing, and that it will help VHHP residents become stable.",0.0
False,,"And then we've heard earlier today about the 11-15 Medicaid waiver, which we do hope that some counties utilize to provide opportunities for counties to access federal funds to provide services in housing.",0.0
False,,"There was a federal grant that was announced earlier today for states to be able to fund services in housing as well, and we're hoping that California takes advantage of that grant.",0.0
False,,"I'm not suggesting that we have adequate funds for services in supportive housing, but housing providers are able to create quality supportive housing currently using these existing funding sources.",0.0
False,,"They're able to do this in a way that significantly reduces inpatient stays, emergency room visits, incarceration and ambulance services among veterans and others with significant barriers to housing stability. These projects improve mental health outcomes, substance use treatment services, and quality of life.",0.0

False,,"Stay stably housed after a year, over 83% stay stably housed after two years.",0.0
False,,The biggest challenge housing providers face in cobbling together this complex array of funding sources are the fact that these sources each prioritize different populations.,0.0
False,,"Given the restrictions funding sources already imposed, we strongly advise against legislation that would prioritize one population of homeless veterans over another or that would hamstring the ability of housing providers to use this source of funding flexibly to serve veterans with the greatest need.",0.0
False,,Programs with successful outcomes have always implemented a competitive application process and award the best projects serving highly vulnerable populations.,0.0
False,,"With the clarifications around scoring, we believe that the current guidelines do a really good job in awarding funds to quality projects that planned to serve highly vulnerable veterans.",0.0
False,,"The guidelines already require, for example, serving vets through coordinated entry systems that prioritize people with the greatest need, including those most likely to die on the streets, as Senator Nielsen talked about in his community.",0.0
False,,"We want to avoid that happening, and so the requirements that target people with the most likelihood of dying on the streets is a good direction that the guidelines include.",0.0
False,,We are not in need of legislation to improve a program that is currently not broken. We have been working with the departments to improve scoring for service providers. We agree that there are some issues here.,0.0
False,,The guidelines reward points for lead service providers with clientele made up of at least 20% of veterans living in units restricted to veterans.,0.0
False,,"We believe this requirement is arbitrary. Some service providers serve hundreds of clients every year, sometimes thousands, while others serve a couple dozen, and so a 20% requirement compares service providers on unequal terms.",0.0
False,,"An example is, Skid Row Housing Trust has 2,000 tenants, providing services to those tenants, if 3% are living in restricted households, that's 60 veterans that they're serving.",0.0
False,,"Another service provider that serves over 20% veterans, if they're serving 50 veterans they're only serving 10 veterans living in restricted units so it's an arbitrary percentage.",0.0
False,,"At the same time, veterans receiving services from highly experienced service providers who do not meet the criteria may have achieved more successful outcomes in serving veterans than clients of other less effective service providers who meet this requirement.",0.0
False,,"Finally since few service providers serve veterans predominantly or exclusively, we believe this incentive favors housing providers in specific geographic areas.",0.0
False,,"Although individual veterans experiencing homelessness may have needs similar to non veterans experiencing homelessness in some regards, we do agree Ms. Gun that Service Providers must understand the unique challenges veterans face and how to address their health, housing, and employment needs.",0.0
False,,"Service providers should understand military experience, trauma, and other areas of particular relevance to veterans not shared by non-veterans.",0.0
False,,"In addition, providers should have an understanding of the range of services and benefits available to veterans. And finally, all lead service providers in supportive housing projects should also have experience with the housing-first approach and supportive housing projects.",0.0
False,,"Not only should providers be culturally competent in serving veterans, they should also be culturally competent in serving homeless Californians.",0.0
False,,We hope that the Department for Training and Cultural Competency for strong service providers who lack either of these competencies. Thank you very much for inviting me here and I look forward to your questions.,0.0
False,,"Good afternoon Chairs, Senators, thank you for inviting me today.",0.0
False,,"So, yes, bottom line we are gravely concerned about the sustainability of the projects and ensuring that the services are fully funded over the life of the development, as Ms. King mentioned. The housing that's being constructed with the Prop 41 funds are required to maintain covenants on the affordability requirements for 55 years.",0.0
False,,"And many of the services' funding sources that have been identified and attached to the development projects do not maintain for that period of time, as has been discussed. So, you know, I think what we're doing right now is we're trying to look at ways to structure the overall funding of the project, in order to allow for additional cash flow. You know, I mentioned allowing for a mix of incomes within a project that allows for additional cash flow.",0.0
False,,"Many of the populations that are being served really don't produce income in the project, in order to support the ongoing services that are required in order to keep them appropriately housed and provide the services that are necessary to keep them stable. And so, by providing a mix of incomes, you can kind of pull out that operating income in order to provide those services.",0.0
False,,"That's really a model based upon the funding structure of the entire project. It doesn't work for all populations, and so we have to be sensitive to that. The federal government, both the VA and HUD are partners that we're working very closely with to ensure that the resources that are available and can be attached to the projects are being attached.",0.0
False,,"VASH has been referred to several times during the dialogue, and we're continuing to work with the federal government to see if we can identify more resources.",0.0
False,,You are correct.,0.0
False,,"Not directly for the VHHP program. So, the VHHP program is reserved for the capital improvements-",0.0
False,,associated with the housing. But not-,0.0
False,,"Yeah, we are creating a set of metrics that go well beyond what we would normally be evaluating the success of the projects on. But typically with supportive housing we are the developer sponsors, the support service providers, have identified a number of factors to evaluate the overall success of the outcomes for the residents of the project.",0.0
False,,"We've really augmented those and are continuing to augment those for the VHHP program to ensure that we're getting successful outcomes. The obligation to do that is part of the agreement that we enter into with the development sponsor, that they collect that data on a regular basis. We work very closely with the continuum of care organizations at the local level that really evaluates through a set of data outcomes within the homeless population, generally within their community.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, we are requiring an annual report on the metrics. But in addition to that, we regularly, through our asset management division, do on-site visits that, in this particular program, would include ensuring that the metrics associated with the service provisions, service outcomes are being met.",0.0
False,,We would be glad to do that.,0.0
False,,"So we have, and I'll let Ms. Gunn augment my response, but we have received a number of legal opinions in regards to any fair housing issues related to having gender specific housing. Certainly where there's been a preponderance of military sexually related trauma that, as you mentioned, is generally gonna be in the female gender and, therefore, in order ensure the safety and security and mental well-being of the population, you know, ideally you have a gender specific development.",0.0
False,,"And so we, at this point, have a legal opinion that states that we really will have to evaluate on a case by case basis if folks come forward with a gender specific development as to, you know, the types of services that are necessarily in order to address underlying service needs of that population and the needs for ensuring a gender specific development. And so it will be at this point what we're anticipating is it'd be on a case by case basis. I'll let-",0.0
False,,"I'm sorry, if I could just. I'm sorry, I just wanted to chime in on your question around engagement of participants in services. And we do see that this use of motivational interviewing and voluntary services tends to actually be much more successful than requiring somebody to participate in services, we see over 90% participation in services and generally in supportive housing programs. And we can certainly provide those data to you.",0.0
False,,"I think that the key here is that a development sponsor typically has a development in the queue for, at a minimum 18 months, 24 months, 36 months. And so when we bring in a new program that has new requirements in order for them to go back and retro-fit the funding sources, the types of units, the type of population being addressed,",0.0
False,,"that takes awhile, and especially because we were forcing marriages, new marriages between service providers, and case managers, and the development community, and so because it was such a condensed process and the developments that came in round one and probably in round two had been in the queue for quite some time. They needed to be able to absorb the new requirements, and so I think as the program goes along we'll have more of an ability,",0.0
False,,"especially if the program requirements stay relatively consistent to kind of absorb the new requirements and determine whether or not as they are determining the feasibility of the project, whether they wanna integrate VHHP into their project.",0.0
False,,"No, there's no consideration",0.0
False,,"I would just add that both AB 35 and SB 377 would have, for every dollar invested by the state, $2 would have been brought into the state by the federal government and federal tax credit resources. So, we did lose pretty much $2 for each dollar we would have invested, and it is, I agree, it's a shame that didn't pass or didn't get signed, but I am hoping that this year will be a little different and we'll be able to get some more resources for housing that could bring in federal investment.",0.0
False,,"This is all, yeah, it's all regulatory, it's not statutory. The more specific guidelines much of which is been discussed today.",0.0
False,,"I think a couple years ago, and somebody else may wanna chime in as well, I think two years ago, I believe this Legislature passed a pilot project for Social Impact Bonds, specifically for reintegrating former, it's for reentry of folks coming out from the criminal justice system. And so I don't think that there's any data yet from that program, but I know that they're in the process of implementing that the pilot program now. And so we should be probably getting data relatively soon.",0.0
False,,"Right, I think in the counties that have very low vacancy rates, the 75% rate is pretty consistent. I know in LA County, our housing authorities are leasing up at a rate of 75%, which is definitely very low for the nationwide lease up.",0.0
False,,"So it is definitely concerning, and as several people mentioned, this program is really good in creating more apartments available that can be leased, but I think that continues to be a problem in sectioning as well in a lot of our counties.",0.0
False,,There are definitely limitations.,0.0
False,,"I think we have, as Tia just mentioned, we have allowed some additional creativity in the larger loan limits for the supportive housing for extremely low income folks in order to reduce some of the operating costs that are needed to continue the sustainability of that capital investment, but outside of that, I mean we have pretty significant limitations on what we can use the funding for.",0.0
False,,Bond money.,0.0
False,,"If I can add, I was involved in the drafting of the legislation, and the original legislation did include money for services operating end capital.",0.0
False,,"Not really credit enhancements but what ended up happening is the Governor's office did push back that there is a provision in the California Constitution that bond money needs to go for a single purpose. So it can be used, technically, if the law had been structured this way solely for operating, or solely for services, or solely for capital, but it couldn't include all three.",0.0
False,,So that's my recollection of the negotiating and taking out those other two.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, it really is a demonstration that you have in place, the ability to have the ongoing operations and service support. And so in terms of what that source is, there's no differentiation in terms of the scoring.",0.0
False,,"So for all the money you put in, you get a boost.",0.0
False,,"We had three projects total that came in with MSHA funding. My understand is that one has now taken that funding out, and the other two are considering whether the units would actually be segregated from, so they wouldn't be layered on top of the VHHP, they would be within the same project, but not layered on top of each other.",0.0
False,,"So you might have some MHSA and VHHP in a single project, but not in a single unit.",0.0
False,,"And I think that the inverse is also true in terms of overlaying the image to say on the vet units. You know, that it will limit the types of veterans that can be served. And so things like substance abuse and you know, other underlying conditions won't fit within the image of safe requirements, and so therefore we're more narrowly targeting the veterans that we could serve in the program by layering the two.",0.0
False,,There were three projects that initially came in with MHSA as a part of their funding.,0.0
False,,And one has since removed MHSA from the project.,0.0
False,,17.,0.0
False,,"To clarify, there were three projects that originally came in with MHSA, and one has since removed MHSA as a funding source. So there were actually three that came in initially with that.",0.0

We, in Stockton, recently had a hack-a-thon about water, where we just invited young folks to come in and work on developing apps or whatever ideas. So, I'm incredibly supportive of the idea.

False,,"I think, again, I think your intention is great. But I think the amount it appropriates to, to set up the criteria, I don't know that that meets your goal.

As I begin, I want to make sure and thank you, and the Committee staff, for the collaborative effort with my office on this bill. Today I would like to introduce AB 26. AB 26 would require that anyone who is applying to obtain a license to cultivate, distribute, dispense or manufacture medical marijuana have an agent and employee training certification program.",0.0
False,,"The need for AB 26 comes from an unresolved issue following the signing of the trio of bills, AB 266, AB 243 and SB 643, which created the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act in 2015.

False,,"Thank you, Mark Mcdonald McCallum group, on behalf of the Los Rios, San Bernardino, San Diego, and South Orange County College Districts, in support.

False,,"Thank you very much, Chair Bonilla, Chair Bonta, Chair Dodd. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak here today regarding the new medical marijuana regulation and safety act I am Awet Kidane, and I am the Director of the Department of Consumer Affairs. Before I go into the implementation I want to provide this body some background and context into my Department of consumer affairs. As some of you may know, the primary mission of the department is consumer protection.",0.0
False,,"We currently oversee 41 boards and bureaus that issue licenses in over 250 categories. With the passage of the act, my department is now responsible for establishing the Bureau of Medical Marijuana, which will license and regulate dispensaries, distributors, and transporters. In partnership with my colleagues, the Department of Food and Agriculture, and the Department of Public Health, I will continue to directly oversee the formation of policy and regulations related to medical cannabis.",0.0
False,,"We will work closely to implement the new act by January 1, 2018. Let's be clear, this is an aggressive timeline and for that very reason, I asked my staff to begin the work of implementation immediately after the bills were signed. Early on, our focus has been on education. In order to fully understand the industry that the department is now mandated to regulate, we have been actively engaging our partner agencies, industry experts, and local government. Additionally, in partnership with the Department of Food and Agriculture, we have already received demonstrations from various companies with track and trade systems and identified some potential high level business leads for an IT solution.",0.0
False,,"To accomplish the implementation we have identified by 2018, we have broken this into four phases. The first phase is hiring staff necessary to promulgate regulations in the first phase. The second is developing those regulations. The third is the information technology implementation or IT solution. The fourth and final phase is licensing and enforcement. In phase one, we have focused on hiring staff to draft the necessary regulations and hold stakeholder meetings.",0.0
False,,"We have already been working with the Department of Finance to identify our initial resource needs and we'll be hiring staff over the next coming months. During the second phase, we will develop and notice the regulations. I'm committed to making this process open and transparent with a focus on stakeholder engagement. My staff has already been reaching out to the public at industry events and has encouraged involvement in the development of regulations.",0.0
False,,"By engaging public stakeholders before we formally notice all interested parties, we have an opportunity to provide insight and understanding of the industry and local government and also for those parties to understand what a regulatory entity is, so there is thought sharing back and forth. Once regulations are drafted and publicly noticed, the department at that point will likely get a better understanding and a sense of our internal business requirements of a IT solution.",0.0
False,,"That leads me to the third phase, members. At this point, we will focus on IT implementation. Once we have a sense of the regulatory requirements, we will quickly shift focus to implementing our new licensing system. This point this will including hiring additional IT staff and working with our partner licensing agencies to ensure that there is continuity across all of the licensing agencies. The last and final phase, phase four, the department will focus on licensing and enforcement.",0.0
False,,"This will include hiring staff, training and developing the licensing enforcement staff required for this, and finally application intake. Want to be clear members, throughout all of these phases, I will continue to have regular updates regarding the bureau, coordinate with our partner agencies, and communicate with this body and the public. This is a very diverse and exciting industry and we will be working with many stakeholders to get this right. With that, let me thank this body again for allowing me the opportunity to speak and I welcome any questions that you may have.",0.0
False,,"Appreciate that question, Chair Dodd. Absolutely. The importance of an Advisory Committee is they are the subject matter experts and they are the direct representatives of the multiple representatives of the stakeholders. It is no different than advisory committees that I already have in place for some of my larger bureaus. Private, post-secondary, my bureau for security and investigative services. Both serve a very important role. Go to those advisory committees to get information, feedback on very contentious issues, and I can see that playing out here.",0.0
False,,"In addition to underscoring what Undersecretary Huston and Dr. Smith said, I think something that I've Learned through working with the various states, as well as going on tours, It really highlighted to me the need to strike a fine balance between my mandate, which is consumer protection and the regulation of this industry, but also compliance and making sure that we don't over-regulate in our zeal to get things right.",0.0
False,,"That, and my colleagues said it very well as well, requires education. I'm seeking to be very knowledgeable in this, but there are people much smarter than I that you will hear from, that I seek counsel from. We seek counsel from each other, and through that process, it's gonna help guide our hand in the promulgation of regulations. I would say that is one of the most important things through this process is striking that fine balance and communication.",0.0
False,,"Madam Chair, thank you for that question, very good question, and it's relevant across, almost all of my licensing population. The question of training as the fields evolve, as technology improves, etc., training is very relevant. So, generally, I would say training is absolutely vital.",0.0
False,,"Training of what and how is yet to be determined until we start promulgating regulations, having a clear understanding of what we're regulating, how we're gonna regulate it, how specific these regs are gonna be, what's gonna be required. And then the gap between the regulations and the population will point a very clear light on where that training should fill in. The method by which, is yet to be determined.

False,,"It's a challenging issue, we know it's not easy to fix. But we need to take time this year doing what we can to fix it this year. The second issue which has not been raised at all is an issue relative to extraction. It may be an issue we're dealing with solely in San Jose. I'm not sure.",0.0
False,,"But San Jose has concerns about criminal law in California that basically says it's a criminal violation to extract the properties out of marijuana. It's and issue that we need to take care of so that we can make sure that as this industry matures, and we're doing more and more away from combustible marijuana, that we're not shutting ourselves up by making people criminally liable. Appreciate the time and look forward to working with you. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Jennifer Coon, Legislative Analyst Office, I think that's one of the things we're trying to point out as one of the difficulties you face in looking at the teacher workforce, is it fluctuates and with a very strong relationship to state funding. And so the state goes through a recession, you see this environment where there are pink slips. It doesn't look like you'll be able to be stably employed right after you finish your teacher prep program.",0.0
False,,"And so you see this dip in enrollments. But you also see some teachers that do finish programs that can't get jobs, and so what you're facing now is what happened to those teachers. Can we encourage them to be sort of re-attracted to the teaching profession?",0.0
False,,"And given we don't know what's on the horizon, when the next recession will come. What if we implement certain strategies now? Will they be effective by the time we want them to be? You face these really sort of big tensions between the state environment and your sort of responses to dealing with changes in the work force.",0.0
False,,"You know this, but California does have generous financial aid, so about half of college students do graduate without debt. Those who do graduate, the other half, carry on average what you mentioned in this range of 20, $25,000 in debt. Whether that is precluding teachers, I don't know if the evidence bears that, because also as you mentioned, they sort of realized going into the profession the salary schedule's very clear, they know what they'll get paid typically at their local district.",0.0
False,,"Many of them stay local so states across the country have tried things like signing bonuses, differential salary schedules. There might be things that once they become teachers will help them over the long run and or encourage them after they've gotten through their prep program to stay maybe longer than they otherwise would have.",0.0
False,,"The state could consider things like measuring, sort of publicizing teacher turn over rates a little bit more than maybe they do already, maybe differences in districts and see if they can help districts with higher turn over rates.",0.0
False,,"You know what, Dan's been spending a lot of time pouring over the research. And what's difficult for us is almost every time you find a program that works in this state, a loan forgiveness program, you find another state where it didn't work. And the ingredients to the program seem somewhat similar, so do loan forgiveness programs work? One worked in Florida.",0.0
False,,"Our program didn't have stellar results. We were asked to look at that last year. Do grants work? Well grants certainly help folks cover the cost of their teacher prep programs. Would they have otherwise been teachers? We don't know. We're sort of guessing as to whether the grant made a significant difference. And because of all this other factors, economic development, state funding, pink slips,it's hard to really control for these isolated effects.",0.0
False,,"One of the most robust findings is that salary differentials tend to help, and not support programs, particularly for beginning teachers, tend to help. California for decades had a support program, explicitly, the state created the rules. When it developed the Local Control Funding Formula it kept that money and gave it to districts and said now we're gonna hold you accountable through student results, and through measuring missed assignments. It still has the money there, it's just a little less prescriptive today.",0.0
False,,"And there in the L caps a few, like one teacher, related, tell us about your mis-assigned teachers, but again, there's some concern that L caps are already complicated, and so another tension before you. If you wanted to give some teacher dynamics a higher profile, within the L cap, how might you do that?",0.0
False,,"Yeah, again, we have been looking at these. I don't know if there's a single great meta study and California itself hasn't done a meta study. In terms of looking at, California itself has had loan forgiveness grant programs, support programs for beginning teachers, for veteran teachers. We've tried to offer incentives for districts to develop alternative compensation schedules.",0.0
False,,"We've evaluated as a state some of those programs, but we haven't said what the dollar for the grant program would be less effective than the dollar for the support program. I'm not aware of any study out there in the country that does that sort of comparative analysis. If we only have $1, where would be the next place that we'd put it?",0.0
False,,"That's our challenge. We're trying to help the state figure out where that next dollar should go and the best we can sort of say is we think salary differentials and support programs work. With the state has done the support stuff, has evaluated it, has found that it to be effective, still has money for many districts, still doing what they are doing with it. And then the salary differentials are just much more difficult as this say willing to pay special a teachers more or science teachers more does not wanna embark on that conversation. Now having said that, one final comment.",0.0
False,,"The state for a while had wanted to develop a teacher longitudinal database, which would have allowed the state to do workforce studies. How long are teachers? Which kinds of teachers are staying and which kinds of districts? Which ones seem to be trying some things we could learn from? We don't, it was dismantled a number of years ago, but it could be one way where you could in California be doing more sort of periodic assessment of what might be working.",0.0
False,,"And the federal government does sample. Teachers every four years, they sample California teachers as part of that endeavor. We requested the data, so my colleague, we have access to that as an office. We're trying to explore.  It does tell us, for example, why teachers leave. So apps in the California database, it's the best we've got right now. We're trying to cull it.",0.0

And keeps over 90% of tenants stably housed over long periods of time, even among those who have been homeless for decades.

False,,"And the reason is, is because we don't have enough housing that's affordable to people in deep poverty.

False,,"But I think that requires some capital investment to create more housing that's affordable to people specifically in deep poverty. And that really would allow us to create more housing opportunities for those who need supportive housing. It would help us create more housing opportunities for people who are on the verge of homelessness and would fall into homelessness but for that housing, so I think that's one key piece.",0.0

False,,"It's difficult to rent to somebody with a voucher.

So if the state is paying these title five direct contract centers that have the developmentally appropriate requirements loves less today than this other. Then it raises this question.",0.0
False,,"Well, how much does it cost to provide that level of care? But we have, even though the regional market rate, the voucher rates, the title 22 rates, on average, are higher today. And so Virginia's indicating it would cost some money, to get to those higher rates, but then I think, also embedded in your question is well, what if we're asking more of those providers?",0.0
False,,Is there an additional amount we would need to provide? And that's sort of up for debate. You could provide some one time money to get existing providers better qualified if you were to raise the requirements you're placing on them. But it's not entirely clear from the evidence you would have to pay a higher rate for that.,0.0
False,,"You could just end the adjustment, and keep with the rate structure you have on the voucher side. It could be enough to do what you're asking them to do.",0.0
False,,"And so, as some of you might recall, childcare has been in and out of 98 and different slices of it over time have been in, out, and in. And we as an office haven't made pronouncements on the right place for putting it.",0.0
False,,"Our general concern has just been that you have policy rational for doing it, and that you treat the programs consistently over time.",0.0
False,,"And this year under the governor's proposals and our assessment of this proposals, he has no major shifting in and out.",0.0
False,,"There are also sort of complicated interactions between eligible population and the market. So for example on the contract side we have CD a lot, contract to counties, particular providers a certain number of slots. If they can't be met, then they reallocate those to centers that do have capacity.",0.0
False,,"So some of it's being driven by the capacity and the willingness, desire of providers to open around the state. And that can be driven by factors that aren't necessarily just, I have an eligible population to serve. They can be driven by, I've got private pay clients in the area and I've so got some subsidized clients, I can make ends meet. So as much of child care is sort of a more complicated answer.",0.0
False,,"It hasn't entirely been driven by state policy to have these inequities, it's just the way the state has done business has allowed them to materialize.",0.0
False,,"Yes, the state would have to consider the capacity, the rules, how it defines eligibility, how it makes payments. These things would be intertwined to actually do the equalization, where the state to decide it wanted to head in that direction.",0.0
False,,"For our 2004 report we made a few maps to try to share with you, but became a little uncomfortable because the underlying data, because we don't have this perfect match between low income and working families, so we decided not to include. So the best we have is that, about 20% of the eligible population, less than that across counties is being served.",0.0
False,,We do know more eligible children are served in San Francisco than in Tulare. The Bay Area than the Central Valley. But we weren't quite confident we could have gradations that were so fine that they would give you much more than that.,0.0
False,,"So there are a variety of things that are happening. I think were you to look just at state funding, you would still see differences across counties because of these things we were mentioning a moment ago, where contracted slots or voucher slots, how they were distributed by the state over the course of decades. You'll also find differences in how counties pooled together federal funding,",0.0
False,,"first five funding, private funding. And so those will also, in some cases, magnify the differences across counties. So, for example, the Bay Area is making a concerted effort to combine first five with some federal money they received with state money.

False,,"has its own compliance monitoring system that checks their books. And the voucher program has AP agencies, and the state and community care licensing that are checking, both that they're meeting standards and their books. I think what we're getting at is, because the data's just not so great, and we were talking about the cells a little bit earlier with the waiting list,",0.0
False,,unfortunately we don't know as much about the service population and any duplication in programs in terms of a child being served clear multiple. That's what's making that difficult to know exactly the share of the eligible population served across the state.,0.0

False,,"We'll send out community care licensing. They'll ensure health and safety, they won't be checking developmental components. So by design, California is allowing very similar children to get access to different care at different rates, with different standards, with potentially different providers.",0.0

False,,"There's still lots of decisions, policies at the Legislature could put in place to give those three year olds, those families a year heads up as to what their program might look like a year from now, because both on the preschool and the child care side, we think there are significant flaws with the existing policies. As you are hearing, the administration isn't offering you much detail.",0.0

We are pleased to voice our strong support for AB 1746, which would build on authorizations codified in AB 946 to allow six additional transit entities to use the shoulders of certain state highways as transit bus only traffic corridors. The targeted use of highway shoulders for transit bus only traffic has come in practice in states across the nation including Georgia, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, and Washington, as well as, in Canada and numerous European countries. In 2005, California got first hand exposure to bus on shoulder through a pilot program operated by SANDAG in coordination with the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System, Caltrans and CHP.",0.0
False,,"In all these cases, the use of highway shoulders for transit bus only traffic has shown that it improves bus performance and reliability, bolsters customer satisfaction, and attracts new patronage without impacting the safety of riders or the general public. We therefore believe that broadening the use of bus and shoulder beyond limited authorizations and current law, while maintaining strong approve and oversight rules for Caltrans and CHP is a sensible approach for quickly enhancing transit service and attracting new transit ridership without significant new cost to the State of transit entities. For these reasons, we respectfully urge for aye vote on AB 1746.",0.0
False,,"Sure thing. Chair Frazier and members, Michael Pimentel with the California Transit Association. Here, today, to voice the Association's long-standing support and appreciation for the work that the Institute for Transportation Studies carries out.

And so by tightening up the language, and working with the Governor's office, not only will you get this bill through, but I think you may have a favorable outcome on the back end when you get to the Governor's desk.

False,,That address some of the problems with the elderly abuse and so here's why the recommendation from the chair is going to be no. You're absolutely right. We have to work on the number of people that have gone to the county level and the over crowding there.,0.0
False,,"In fact, I believe the Governor has put another $250 million in the budget to help with the over crowding and to build more jail facilities, but the most important component of that which is what I think the opponents are trying to address, but they may not have said it well.",0.0
False,,"When people go to jail for a crime, we're trying to rehabilitate them so they don't do it again. When they go to county we do have to put in more programs to reduce the amount of recidivism. When you go to prison, a lot of people get a PhD in how to commit a crime. And so sending people to prison without any type of mechanism to rehabilitate them, will only make them better at their craft and further victimize the most vulnerable in our community.",0.0
False,,"And as a great man once told me, which I hope we would do more of, he criticized the Legislature by saying the Legislature creates laws they don't really create solutions.

False,,"But also making sure that we can figure out a way that people who are victimized, we can get some type of restitution which I believe needs to be done. But I also know when you send someone to prison, just as I put in a bill for whether or not you could pay alimony and child support payments while you're were in prison.",0.0
False,,"Well you can't. You can't make a dime while you're in prison, and so to have that build up over time didn't make any sense. What made sense is to get people out of prison and become productive citizens so they can make restitution not only to the elderly, but to this community.",0.0
False,,"And to give back what they've taken from us. And so while I definitely value everything that you said, and you're absolutely right that we need to do more. We need to do a comprehensive look as one of my esteemed colleagues has said earlier, that it really addressed it and to solve this problem in a big picture.",0.0

In your closing, I just want you to clarify whether or not there are any court cases, I know you're a lawyer, that would make this unconstitutional. Would that be a problem?

False,,"I'm not concerned at all about the 10 year probation on carrying a firearm.

I also think it gets to the point, to the whole process of getting the guns out of felons' hands and criminals' hands and gang members' hands and others who make it a habit of filing false reports. I think we all agree we want to get it out of their hands and have a long term prohibition on them having access to those weapons.

We believe it sets a bad precedent in how California deals with grievances. It will load new administrative costs onto the health plans at a time when we really need to be conscious about affordability in the health insurance market.,0.0
False,,"And in our view it's designed to compel the coverage of more costlier drugs when more cost efficient drugs are ont he market. So just by way of background, California for several years has had a system in place to deal with grievances, Enrollees have access to an independent medical review or IMR administered by the state and is funded by the health plans.

It's the health plan's job, of course, always to make sure that we're investing premium dollars in good care.",0.0
False,,"This bill is asking us to treat covered prescription drugs differently from every other service. And to obtain a result for the enrollee within a very tight 24-hour time frame under emergency circumstances. We believe that this is an overly aggressive time frame and we lead to one of two bad results in our view. One, the plan medical directors that are reviewing the case, may be compelled to just cover the requested drug, even if it's inappropriate for that particular person.",0.0
False,,"Or even if it's a widely expensive compare to other alternatives that are on the formulary. Number two, the likelier result is that the plan will just deny more requests due to the lack of time and information.

There's about three bills in the past, AB 1452, which was the bill that would basically require that the daily rate be increased for hotel and motel stay, from $65 to $75, and to coalitize it. In 1987, when the bill was enacted, it was $30. That took another 12 years before it went up to $40 in 1999.",0.0
False,,"And then we had to wait for another 7 years until 2006 that went up to $65, and now it's stayed at $65 for the past 8 years, and we need to change that.

False,,"So their net spendable income is not that much. In fact often, their worse off working than they were without working. So that's why we need to increase the work incentive. For example, a very big problem is the sanctions.  In California, in January there was 111,000 people participating in the Welfare-to-Work program, and there were 58,000 people who were sanctioned.",0.0
False,,"That's a large sanction, that's a lot of people being sanctioned. I dug into the numbers a little bit, and the reason that people are often sanctioned is because they don't go to appraisal. That's when they go to appointment, and then they're called into appraisal.",0.0
False,,"Most sanctions are caused because of lack of transportation and lack of child care. And before a person is scheduled for appraisal, they never verify that the person has safe adequate childcare, or the person has transportation. So therefore, often people don't show up, and therefore they're sanctioned.",0.0
False,,"And the grant study showed that many sanctions are caused because of supportive services. Just looking at the report in January, there were 58,000 or 59,000 people in Welfare-to-Work in unsubsidized employment, and only 56,000 people got transportation out of 111,000 people.",0.0
False,,"So even the people who are working are not getting the transportation, and they cannot beam over from here to there. They have to incur transportation costs, and the law says that they're entitled to transportation. So I guess the proposal basically is to verify supportive services before a person is assigned to Welfare-to-Work activity, to protect the children and assure that they're not vulnerable to sanctions.",0.0

False,,"Because now it's a two-parent family, they say, you're working over 100 hours, and the whole family was cut off of CalWORKS. So she had two choices, if she leaves the guy, if she stays with the guy She can't pay the rent, if she kicks the guy out of the house, they should pay the rent.",0.0

False,,"During the inflationary times of the late 70s and early 80s, we raised the minimum wage 67% in three years. In the early 70s we raised it 51% in 2.5 years. I would note that two of those raises were done under the signature of Governor Reagan,",0.0

So I applied those criteria to that view of where would our minimum wage be today.",0.0

False,,"It does do what we have done over a 100 years which is the pressure builds up. And then we act with a much more substantial increase bounced out with this indexing with the cap. Finally, I want to make a couple of additional points, some of which have been made by members earlier.",0.0

It's only earned by someone working very, very hard in difficult jobs, repetitive jobs.

And I'll tell you, people talk a lot about global warming as being the issue of our time.",0.0
False,,"I actually think the issue is income inequality. That when you drill down to what creates destabilization within society and within democracies, it is the gap between the haves and the have nots. It's destabilizing and it's dangerous, and it does require our careful attention.",0.0
False,,"And it does require thoughtful action, which I believe is reflected in the bill that's before us. No bill is perfect.

Nick Louizos, on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans in opposition to SB 908 because it enacts new disclosure requirements on health plans that we believe are unnecessary and potentially misleading. It creates new special enrollment options that we feel causes disruption in the market. And it also results in punitive rate freezes that we believe are unfair.",0.0
False,,SB 908 specifically requires plans to send individual enrollees or small employers a new and distinct notice separate from the notices that they already receive when a State Regulator has deemed a rate increase as unreasonable under the existing rate review system. We believe this is problematic for a number of reasons.,0.0
False,,"And number one, the new notice under SB 908 fails to include a critical feature of federal regulations, which allows a health plan to explain its rationale of moving forward with the rate. And secondly, the proposed notice may imply to the consumer that they must switch to a new product, which is not the case under existing law. If individuals and employers misinterpret this notice, we believe it will cause needless churn in the market.",0.0
False,,"We just have to note that consumers already receive a rate renewal notice at the annual open enrollment period. At that time they can evaluate A rate increase, if there is one, and can make a decision accordingly either to stay with their current product or to make a switch. We also oppose SB 908 because it gives effected consumers new enrollment options even after the annual open enrollment period has closed.",0.0
False,,"We believe that's highly problematic. We do acknowledge that special enrollment periods are sometimes necessary, but regulators both at the state and federal level are actually reevaluating some of these enrollment options and refining their current lists of options in order to ensure more stable insurance market.",0.0
False,,"In some cases, special enrollment periods are being eliminated by the federal government. So, we think that creating more enrollment options, under this bill, actually overlaps with the existing open enrollment process, can create to uncertainty and lead to unforseen costs for all consumers. Particularly objectionable component to the bill is that it freezes rates and in some cases require the health plan to go back in time and change rates after a new rate has gone into effect.",0.0
False,,"We're not sure how our members are going to comply with that. And it again creates more uncertainty in the market, particularly as it pertains to rate development.",0.0
False,,"So there are many components to the rate development process, I'm not going to pretend to be an actuary. And health plans always must be adequate enough to meet the demands in the experience of the covered lives, as well as the reality of rising health care costs, particularly skywriting prescription drug prices, and hospital costs. Predictability always helps in developing adequate and accurate rates.",0.0
False,,But freezing rates and allowing people to come into the market outside of an open enrollment period or the existing special enrollment periods makes it harder to price products and this creates uncertainty and unforeseen costs for the healthcare market.,0.0
False,,"So for those reasons, we are opposed to SB 908, thank you.",0.0

False,,"I'll outline those very quickly, I think I would say though we're not opposed to the underlying objective. I think the issue is that it could create some delays in the development of new housing. And so specifically, what I wanted to point out is that for home builders, we're actually not in the business of creating new water systems.",0.0
False,,"Our preference is to work with the existing public water system and if that's not possible, our next best option is to annex within that service area. All that must be approved by LAFCO, and this process already involves extensive discussions and negotiations with the water system. And we only pursue a new water system as a last resort.",0.0
False,,"And so the bill actually sort of, after you're denied, sends you back. It has the board directed to go back to start those discussions again, and we think we've already said no, it's sort of futile. And we think that the process is a bit circular. And I think the other issue is, and I think Cindy Tuck ACWA will mention this, we're concerned that the bill authorizes the board to only deny a permit, even when the applicant meets the technical, financial, and managerial requirements.",0.0
False,,"So we think, rather than just a straight denial, they were going to impose some conditions on that process. That makes more sense as opposed to just saying no, even when you can check off all the boxes. So again, we look forward to working with the author to work out some of these issues.",0.0

False,,"For African-Americans it's one in four. During my prime years of my career I would see one year's graduating class drop after four years by 170, by 125, by 100. And I'd asked, where are these students going? And I never really got an answer.",0.0
False,,"Mostly because they just gave up. The dropout rate is driving the nation's increasing prison population so that's another one of our worries.

But I think the most compelling statistic I want to leave you with today is the fact that 29% of the respondents said that if there is nothing changed to the funding for after school programs, they will close their doors within the next two years. It's a frightening, frightening prospect when you think of the 400,000 kids, low income kids, in very impoverished neighborhoods, who are receiving these services now.",0.0

False,,They have their home addresses shielded from inspection for their own protection. This shielding of information occurs when a peace officer queries the DMV database for information on a person's license plate.

False,,"And the administration through the Department of Health Care Services has acknowledged that homelessness does significantly impact MediCal. When they proposed a new MediCal waiver last year, that waiver proposed using MediCal dollars to pay for housing, to pay for rental subsidies for chronically homeless individuals.",0.0

False,,"The administration is also working on creating a new health home benefit. That benefit is through the Affordable Care Act, it's largely funded by the federal government, 90% funded by the federal government and it would fund on an ongoing basis those same services.",0.0

And we do appreciate the author's' efforts to look at different and more creative ways of finding housing, but we must respectfully oppose this approach. The requirement to assess the potential addition of housing on top of an existing public facility simply isn't viable. In order to add additional floors to existing operating public facilities, it must be built with the knowledge or the potential of adding that additional housing so that the structure meets code requirements to carry the weight and height of that added housing development. Other than single family homes, our planners haven't seen any significant additions to floors to existing buildings and don't believe that it would be easy to do so. And we don't object to the bill's requirement that the inventory of sites include a review of underutilized sites to determine if they are viable for a housing development.",0.0
False,,"However, we just want to note that it may not result in additional housing depending on when the current site is available and when it might be, excuse me, when it might be available for development.

However, we are concerned that this would restrict the board of trustee's ability to respond to significant economic changes and changes in say general fund support.",0.0
False,,"And we believe, under this policy that we would create a situation in which different entering groups of students would be paying dramatically different tuition, as the next entering class would have to fully bear the adjustments needed year to year, given a recession or change in general fund support.

False,,"We share Ms. Barrera's concerns that the chamber enumerated. I want to address a couple additional points beyond the federal preemption issue. The first is the allegation that private arbitration is essentially unregulated, a private industry where anything goes, and that arbitrators are unregulated.",0.0
False,,"There are numerous court decisions and clearly a number of statutes that are outlined in your Committee analysis. So it is regulated in many instances, and there are specific provisions for when a contract award can be vacated in the code of civil procedure. Similarly, there are mandatory disclosure provisions related to arbitrators.",0.0
False,,"There are extensive Judicial Council rules that were adopted in California in 2002. Our arbitrator disclosure rules are much more extensive than those applicable to judges. Moreover, the two largest providers of arbitration services, Triple A and Jams have extensive disclosure rules. And so, there is extensive regulation of arbitrators and the arbitration system.",0.0
False,,"We believe that arbitration is cost effective and timely. I realize that the critics, opponents of arbitration feel differently. And your analysis states that its costly and unreceptive to consumers. 15 years ago, the California Supreme Court came out with the Arminderos decision.",0.0
False,,"And requires five items to be in a mandatory employment arbitration agreement, that would be applicable in this instance. One of which is cost to be born by the employee. Those are all born by the employer.",0.0
False,,"In fact, under the Triple A rules, an employee filing an arbitration claim can pay no more than $250. All other costs are born by the employer. We find studies extensively show that employees and",0.0
False,,"consumers do better than or at least the same as they do in court. For example, a recent study, 65% success of employees in arbitration, 61% in court. Of course, speediness is one of the most essential components of arbitration.",0.0
False,,"The average arbitration takes less than 12 months. The average court decision is two to three years, 31 months in Northern California, alone. We respectfully disagree with the proponents that somehow arbitration forces you to waive constitutional or statutory rights. We know that the Seventh Amendment applies to criminal cases.",0.0
False,,"But more importantly, just because you sign an arbitration agreement, does not mean you give up your substantive rights. For example, you can't force an employee to sign an arbitration agreement and pay them a lower minimum wage. You can't pay based on gender differently after the additional changes to the Fair Pay Equity Act of SB 358 of last year.",0.0
False,,"So you cannot waive those. Arbitration is a different forum, not a waiver of subsistence rights. And finally, how are employees or veterans benefited by this bill? We think the disputes will simply go into our overburdened and underfunded courts.",0.0
False,,"It will result in greater delays in litigation but there will be additional costs on employees even if they lose most fee agreements with attorneys. While they may lose and waive their fees, costs are often born by the employees. There are often lack of lawyers in these cases.",0.0
False,,"For example, Major Lively's wife just testified. She went through 25 lawyers to find one to take her case. So there's clearly a dearth of employment litigators here. And lastly, the beneficiaries are going to be the attorneys.",0.0
False,,"Let me just cite two examples why consumer class action benefits lawyers and not employees or consumers. In Starks versus Jimmy Johns in the LA Superior Court, $5,000 to the named employee, $1.40 coupon for each class member, over $370,000 fees for the attorney.",0.0
False,,"In McCleery versus relations company, 5,000 to the named plaintiff, $6 per class member, up to $18 for drinks. Plaintiff's counsel, 362,000 in fees, 585,000 in costs. We don't see the benefit to the employees with the elimination of arbitration and employment disputes. Thank you.",0.0

False,,"We believe that Israeli Americans should be able to conduct business within the state and with partners from Israel, free from harassment, prejudice, and discrimination. The efforts to delegitimize and discriminate against Israel, Israeli-Americans, or those who simply choose to freely associate with Israel, or Israelis, is well-organized and prevalent in this state, in this day.",0.0
False,,"Well-organized discrimination is certainly not a new phenomenon, not in this country, not around the world.

False,,"The first two are consistent with policies already adopted by this Legislature, and in the process of implementation at the CPUC. And the third one we feel is premature. Last year SB 350 established an integrated resources plan that looks to optimize the use of all resources. Specifically preferred resources in going forward which storage will be a big component of that.",0.0
False,,"As was referenced in earlier testimony, Southern California Edison has really hit the ball out of the park with regard to storage procurement. We had a 50 megawatt target mandate. We procured 264 megawatts of storage, the majority of which is behind the customer side of the meter. So we think that establishing a tarrif's not necessary right now.",0.0
False,,"We also have the ... incentive program which we understand the ... is adding storage to that so customers currently have the ability to access incentives for a storage behind the customer side of the meter. And with regard to establishing a target, as I'd mentioned integrated resources plan does establish that market signal, as well as the market signal by our 2020 goal, established by AB 2514.",0.0
False,,"So it's for these reasons that While we're moving forward with storage.

False,,"Thank you, Madame Chair, and members. I appreciate the opportunity to be here to talk about my top bill of the year. I call it the California Promise. There is a lot that we have to be proud of in terms of our higher education system here in California, from the 2 million plus kids who go to the community colleges to the 450,000 of the CSU and the many that attend the University of California.",0.0
False,,"We take great pride in the quality of the education that's provided and the affordability and in the accessibility. In fact, if you look around the country, these are high watermarks for higher education. that bring a claim to our leaders that run these institutions, the faculty that serve and provide such great quality education to our kids.",0.0
False,,"But there is a place within our higher education system that is not so good and that's in the area of student success. If you look at the four year graduation rate in California at our state Universities, it's near the bottom in the nation. And next to me here is a chart that shows our four year graduation rates at the various campuses within the California State University.",0.0
False,,"You'll see that if you sent your student to Sacramento State this year the likelihood that they would graduate in four years is about 8%. And as a system, as a whole the four year graduation rate is about 18.6%. That's about 25% below the national average for comparable public institutions that we have here in the California State Universities.",0.0
False,,"I've had a lot of opportunity to study this problem, both as a student at San Diego State in my youth, whereas a student leader I attended four years of trustee meetings just prior to being elected to the Senate. In fact, I had to resign my trusteeship with the California State Universities when I was sworn in to the Senate. I'd served there for four years.",0.0
False,,"And it's an issue of great concern, this area of student success. And I know that we have wonderful campus presidents, and faculty, and system wide leaders, and trustees, that spend a lot of time trying to figure this problem out.",0.0
False,,"But a lot of the problem solving that goes into the issue focuses in on the 6 year graduation rate, as if we've just given up on the idea that students who want to get out in four years can do so. A recent UCLA study was done of incoming freshman, and asked them whether they wanted to get through in four years, about 85% said that was their goal when they began at the University.",0.0
False,,"So I have legislation that I think can breakthrough this problem and provide an opportunity for many more kids to get through in four years. I call it the California promise. And the goal of course is to increase the four year graduation rate. By doing so, we lower the cost and that obligations to students. We expand the number degrees that can meet the needs of California employers.",0.0
False,,"We reduce our overall state costs, and we can prepare our community college students for an on-time graduation right when they begin. And the elements of the California promise are fairly simple, and they are as follows. It provides and optional, and I underscore the word optional, contract between the student and the University which as obligations on both sides.",0.0
False,,"On the student's side, it would require that they maintain a minimum unit load of about 30 academic units in an academic year and they maintain a minimum GPA standard. And on the University side, they would provide enhanced academic advising, priority registration, a freeze on tuition so whatever the tuition was when they entered University, if they maintain the requirements of the contract, it would stay the same through all four years.",0.0
False,,"And finally, if through no fault of their own, they were required to take a class for their degree achievement, and it was not available to them, in four years, the University would provide to them at no cost after that four year period had expired. I project that this program if implemented would provide an additional 14,000 students with degrees on time in four years.",0.0
False,,"I would free up seats for incoming students. For those students who were able to graduate in four years instead of five, the estimate by the Campaign for College Opportunity would save those students and their family's $220 million. We would add graduates to our workforce, paying more taxes, certainly earning a salary for the first time in their lives, which would help them and of course our economy.",0.0
False,,"We've had in California, in the state universities, some pilot programs that mirror many of the elements of the California Promise. And two of the most acclaimed programs are at Cal Poly Pomona, and Cal Poly San Bernardino. And those programs, some of which began as early as 2007.",0.0
False,,"And it what we found in those programs is the kids that went through that four year pledge program graduated at twice the regular student graduation rate at the University. So at Pomona, the kids that are in that program are graduating at 40% in four years. 40%, double the school average of little under 20.",0.0
False,,"And at San Bernardino, they're graduating around 23%, also doubling the number of the rate when the program began in 2007. So there's some real signs of a positive path here. I want to underscore that this legislation sets a goal which we've never had before, which was to meet and exceed the national graduation rate. It's about a 25% improvement.",0.0
False,,"So it sets a state wide standard, it lays out the broad parameters of the program as I've described, but it leaves it to the state university system leadership and the community college leadership to undertake it in a way that serves their unique campuses and their unique systems.",0.0
False,,"Finally I want to point out that one of the challenges that we face, and I know you talk about quite a bit, is the achievement gap for students that are K through 12, at our University system. It's important to note that in the Pomona and the San Bernardino programs that the students that were able to be successful in those programs reflected the great diversity of those campuses.",0.0
False,,"At San Bernardino 58% of the participants from Pell Grant recipients, and 83% were traditionally underrepresented students. And at Pomona 70% of the kids in that program are traditionally underrepresented students. So, while this program in and of itself can't close the achievement gap, what we are seeing is that, that desire to get out in four years is attracting the interest of all students of the great diversity that are currently going to our University system.",0.0
False,,"Finally, I've had a great opportunity to visit with the Chair and the Committee staff to talk about this legislation. I certainly appreciate all their constructive input and suggestions we Certainly share the same goals. And I want to respond to the Committee analysis. I think we've worked a number of the issues.",0.0
False,,"The Committee analysis suggests that we delete the community colleges as recommended on page five. But with the Chair's agreement, I'd like to instead amend the bill to define a quote qualifying student with a California Promise program at our community colleges to be the 1440 associate degree for transfer students who utilizes these student's success act services to complete community colleges within two years.",0.0
False,,"So in essence, we're going to build on the good work of this Committee of the Chair, and of the community colleges, in creating the Student Success Act program. We have, of course, the associate degree for transfer program that's recently implemented, so we're going to build on top of those tracks within the California Promise program.",0.0
False,,"So, one of the things that been very important to me is that we not discriminate against students who want to start at the community colleges in terms of getting through in four years, and that means to provide the same benefits that one would get starting at the state universities as they would now get at the community colleges. So within the Student Success Act, we have priority registration, we have enhanced academic advising.",0.0
False,,"I'd like the opportunity to give that same tuition freeze to community college student's as they would be for CSU. And this amendment I think, will satisfy some of the concerns that have been raised about weaving these programs successfully together.",0.0
False,,"And then finally, upon completing an associate degree at the community colleges, a California Promise student would be guaranteed a slot in the California State Universities under the California Promise program. And their tuition would be set at an amount as if they had started at the state universities rather than at the community colleges, in addition to all the benefits that I've further mentioned. Finally, with the chair's approval I'd like to continue to work on the tuition aspect of the bill and the Appropriations Committee. And with that I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"To the Chair, so if the student has said they want to work under the provisions of the California Promise and something comes up in their life that means they can't meet the requirements. They can remove themselves from the program without any penalty. They'll be back in the student body as a whole with the same priority registration that would normally be alloted to them based on their standing in the University.",0.0
False,,"So through the Chair, I'm going to leave that the implementation of the registration priority to the systems and the campuses themselves to make those difficult choices that are there every day today for students, in terms of whether they're able to get that class or they're able to get that pre-requisite. A part of what we're pushing for in this legislation is to get the system to operate more efficiently and have more kids succeed than are succeeding today.",0.0
False,,"That's the foundational elements of why I'm here and why I'm advancing this idea and this legislation. It's because the status quo isn't working, and that most kids are not able to get through. In fact, if you take this, we talk about the four-year graduation rate at the state universities is a little under 19%.",0.0
False,,"You know, the six-year graduation rate is about 57%. And even at those levels, we have 40%. We have not just thousands of students failing, and not even 10 thousands, we have hundreds of thousands of kids that have failed. Our system has failed for them.",0.0
False,,"They have the debt, they have the time commitment, and they have nothing, very little for it. Now, there's some who are engaged in our university system because of the wonderful elements of a higher learning and understanding the world that we live, and so, I don't speak to that great benefit that they would get.",0.0
False,,"But for the vast majority that are trying to achieve a degree and get through in a reasonable amount of time, certainly a sign that maybe they can't afford to spend doing it. The system is failing today. Think about it. It's an 80% failure rate for a four-year degree. And it's an uncomfortable truth that I think that for many here that I've met with, I think there's a lot of surprise.",0.0
False,,"Certainly not for parents and not for kids who are going through it and having trouble, but for many around here, it is a surprise to see the rate being so low, because no one wants to talk about it. But the rates are, it's a pretty big failure. And that failure results, those are numbers of kids who couldn't get their classes, and who couldn't get through. That's what it is. So, I'm trying to be directed to your question. Is some student going to be disadvantaged? We certainly would like to avoid that entirely.",0.0
False,,"Through the Chair. I give the flexibility to the system to, they could take, say an engineering degree that maybe a five-year degree, they could, nothing in my legislation would limit their ability to create that five-year program with that five-year certainty to someone in an engineering degree. 95% of the degree programs at the state universities require 120 units.",0.0
False,,"But yes, there are some that require more. Nothing in this would prevent them from coming up with a program that is applicable to those students in those disciplines. And finally, may I answer one additional point that you make. because a part of the narrative from the state University, and it's one I've always embraced is that we do serve a lot of diverse students that come to us from different walks of life and different challenges in life.",0.0
False,,"They aren't always the ones that can leap to the University of California, take that full load and achieve, right? But there's some interesting things that I discovered as I dug deeper into the facts on that, and I brought a chart to illustrate it.",0.0
False,,"And what this is, is we took all the students that attended the California State University last year, this past fall, which is over 450,000, and we broke down the number of units that they took this fall to try to understand how many kids do we have that can't take that full load because that's what we were always talking about.",0.0
False,,"That's why we talked about the six-year degree as the standard, not the four-year. And here's what we found, that only 13% of the kids enrolling in the fall were taking less than 12 units. Okay? That 87% were trying to get through. They had the capacity to balance the challenges that they were facing.",0.0
False,,"They want to get through as fast as they can. So we see that more than 50% took between 12 and 14 units, and 34% took 15 units or more. And so, they have the capacity, more than we even know, to try to get through. But we have the limitations that we're facing.",0.0
False,,"Now to the ability not to get the classes that they need. Maybe they needed some academic advising help. Here's another interesting factoid. If you take all the kids that didn't graduate this past year from the state universities, as I mentioned, most degree programs are 120 units, that if you wanted to stay on track, that's what you would end up with, the average unit count of a student who graduated last year from the state universities was 135 units.",0.0
False,,"It took an entire extra semester more of time and cost that weren't applicable to a specific degree program. Now, are some kids changing their majors? Yes, no problem. And my legislation will not create any limitation to someone changing their major, running into an issue where they need to take a semester off.",0.0
False,,"It's not going to set them back any different than it sets them back today. But we have a very motivated student body who want to get through and wants to get that degree, and yet, there are road blocks that get in the way. And that's what we're trying to break down in this legislation, where we can serve more students and have more of them achieve than what's happening today.",0.0
False,,"Through the Chair. Those are big questions we face everyday, Senator. Can we adequately fund our University system? Can it provide the access to the many kids whose parents have paid taxes all these years and now want to enter them? And so, it remains a perpetual challenge for all of us.",0.0
False,,"If you would like to put money into my bill to hire more faculty, I think I certainly would be supportive of that. And that's a challenge that we face in general terms of the budget process. If you look at the two pilot programs at Pomona and San Bernardino, what did they do to get that level of success?",0.0
False,,"And this past year in Pomona, they've admitted over 900 kids, so it's not small, 900 kids into their four-year pledge program. They retain one additional counselor, one additional academic advisor. And the costs of the program at that campus was, they estimate it to be about $75,000.",0.0
False,,"So, I don't mean to downplay the heartfelt concern you have about having enough faculty, getting our institutions to be more robustly funded so tuition cannot go up, and we can have the support services and enough faculty to teach all the courses. That remains a long term goal that we all have.",0.0
False,,"I'm trying to for the most part take our existing resources that we're providing, and finding a pathway to using them more efficiently. If we get kids through this faster, everybody saves. The institution, it means they don't have kids in a class that they can offer to somebody else, right?",0.0
False,,"That frees up a seat. That means that they can admit more kids. They can save money to use for other purposes or other enhancements on the campuses. So, at the heart of this is creating an efficiency within our system. I wish it could be providing a lot more money and I certainly would like to work more with you on that.",0.0
False,,"And may I ask through the chair, are you suggesting that we eliminate the tuition freeze, Senator?",0.0
False,,"May I respond, Madam Chair?",0.0
False,,"Okay. The second thing is that there is a working draft that the CSU is going to consider within the coming year about creating a gradual tuition increase over time to stop the spikes and then the depressed times and the spikes that have been happening over the years on tuition. And one of the recommendations that's there is to set it at 2%, a 2% increase a year.",0.0
False,,"If that were to happen under my legislation, it would benefit a student about $55 a semester. $55, it would be about $110 a year. So the benefit to the student over the course of the four years, if tuition was increased 2% every year, and again, it's been flat for the last five, but let's just take that as a scenario, it would save the student and their family about $500.",0.0
False,,"The tuition freeze is not meant as financial aid, it's meant as a small incentive that provides a very modest gain but provides, from a family perspective, some level of certainty that makes this program very, very attractive. Okay, so, I guess my argument back would be that I pledge to the chair to try to work out the issue of the tuition and how that gets reconciled. I don't want to discriminate against a student going to the community college here in Sacramento.",0.0
False,,"If they want to start at the community college because they can't get into Sac State, or that they're hoping to get in, I want them to be able to go to that community college without feeling like they've been discriminated against because they weren't able to start at the California State Universities, so that they could pay the same as a California State University student.",0.0
False,,"And finally, I don't know if you're aware, but that, the tuition policy for the state universities today is about 30% higher than it needs to be. And it's done that way, because they provide that extra 30% as financial aid for about a third of those who enter the state universities.",0.0
False,,"So by policy today, choices are being made about what's the right balance for those who need the help, those who can maybe pay more, and it's a constant struggle. There's no right answer to it. These choices are made when UC charges 12, why? Why do we only charge 5500, why is the fee at community college less?",0.0
False,,"So these are difficult choices that we all need to make, they're not easy. But the tuition freeze, for me, is an attractive element because it's small, but it's a wonderful incentive to stay under contract and get through in four years because the benefit financially, is not just to the student, it's certainly not about the $500 in the four years, it's that we're going to free up seats. So the institution's going to either gain financially or allow us to enroll a lot many more kids.",0.0
False,,"Madame Chair and Senators Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association respectfully opposed to Senate bill 1224. The Senator spoke of a tax. And I got here in 2009, since then every year it seems like there's been a new attack on the teachers seniority system in new and creative ways. CTA places a high value on seniority.",0.0
False,,"More experienced teachers are able to produce better results in the classroom than inexperienced teachers. It's a fact that's pointed out by research. But when we're talking about assignments and reassignments, what are we talking about here? We're talking about when, for example, there are too many teachers at a grade level.",0.0
False,,"Or too many teachers at a school site. What the center's proposing here in reporting that data to the California Department of Education when it occurs based on seniority is simply impractical as the analysis points out there is a number of factors that go into that. So, across the state if you have let's say for example, too many teachers at third grade, not enough at first grade.",0.0
False,,"Usually what the principal would do first is say do we have any volunteers? Does anybody want to go down to first grade? If they don't get a volunteer, they consider a number of factors and seniority is one of those factors. It's also as the analysis points out have they taught anything close to first grade before?",0.0
False,,"Do they have special training? Do they have special credentialing? And in fact, we negotiate language around this area that generally has some pretty wishy-washy language in it, something that says something along the lines of some of the factors that the administrator will consider aside from credentialing and",0.0
False,,"all that other stuff is factors thought to be in the best interest for the operation of the school, something like that. The bottom line is that the administrator is given totally authority to move teachers as they want. And occasionally there will be a grievance that's filed based on that contract language. Generally what that comes from is we've seen some situations where a new principal to a school site feels",0.0
False,,"a little intimidated by the fact that there's a 20 year teacher there who has strong connections into the community, knows all the parents, knows all the history of the school. And in an effort to push that teacher into retirement. In some cases we've seen teacher maybe who's taught kindergarten for 15 years, suddenly being told, you're going to be given a sixth grade assignment.",0.0
False,,"In those cases when that occurs, sometimes we'll file agreements and hopefully negotiate a resolution along the way. Because if it gets to the end of the process, if it gets to arbitration, we lose that case. The state recognizes that the administrators have control to move folks where they want within the school site. Or even out of the school site if there's too many.",0.0
False,,"So it doesn't make sense then if there's a number of factors being considered to have a district report to the state when seniority is the issue, seniority is one of five or six factors that are being considered. Initially volunteers is what occurs, but we abjure opposition. It doesn't make sense, it's impractical.",0.0

And that's a significant issue for us because as new Medi-Cal benefits are implemented it usually takes about two years for the rates to reflect that.

We're actually supporting, in a supportive amended position in a bill in the Assembly that creates a licensing structure for ABA providers.",0.0
False,,"It provides three levels of care. And how plans would benefit from a licensing structure being in place is that there would be, it would be easier to certify the networks, and a process in which we can file a complaint with if there's any issues with the quality of treatment that's being provided.",0.0
False,,"And so I just want to be very clear that initially when 946 was passed, CAP, prior to my tenure there, was opposed to it. Since then we've moved forward with the ACA, with inclusion of autism as a behavioral health benefit under mental health parity.",0.0
False,,And our members are providing it. And we're looking to figure out how we can do it even better in certifying and building our networks. And so we're opposed to this bill today not because we don't want to see the sunset removed for autism care. We actually support that.,0.0
False,,"We have more concerns around how the bill expands existing coverage requirements specifically, the time and location issue. Time and the ability to access timely care is something that or regulators take very seriously.

False,,"As being a former public employee, a manager, you want to take care of this as soon as possible. We felt that having it done within 365 days, within one year was the most appropriate.

That seemed the most appropriate time to do it in.",0.0

False,,"They were just left out. They do this upon physician referral. Physicians are looking for answer then, trying to figure out what's going on with the nerve conduction or in the muscle. This test is done for that, they need it done. The only place that's not being reimbursed right now is in Medi-Cal.",0.0

False,,"Good morning, Dan Caplan with the LAO. You should all be receiving a copy of a handout entitled Teacher Workforce Trends. I believe it's being passed out right now, but to provide a brief overview of what I'll be covering in the interim, I'll be discussing some recent trends in the labor market for teachers, evidence of shortage or shortage areas, a summary of prior policy responses attempted at the federal, state, and local levels to address teacher shortages, and finally, provide some issues for consideration for the Legislature to think about as it begins to ask how to potentially deal with these shortages.",0.0
False,,"But first to provide a summary of the statewide teacher workforce trends. Two of the common trends that are assessed, or two of the common factors that are assessed by many in the research community, when gauging the health of the market for teachers are the number of new credentials issued in a given year, versus the number of hires that districts intend to make in a year and when we look at these two trends as you're receiving your handout, they're located on page two. We'll see that they're somewhat cyclical in nature.",0.0
False,,"The state undergoes periods of time in which we produce more credentials than teachers rehire, and vice versa. So it's about 2010 and '11, we have been hiring more teachers than we have been issuing credentials waiting some to site teachers shortages. However I want to stress that the market's more complex than these two factors and there are many other trends that we should should consider when engaging the true supply of teachers and the true demand for teachers.",0.0
False,,"When at looking at teacher demand the key factor sure to consider, is the level of funding, the state provides, via the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. We find that in about three quarters of the years in which the minimum guarantee grows year over year. We see an increase in projected hires at the district level. In recent years, we're providing, we have been providing more funding to districts, and as a result, we've been seeing more hiring. Similar trends are seen when we decrease the funding that via the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. Other key demand factors to consider are enrollment trends.",0.0
False,,"We seen over the past decade, enrollment has been fairly stagnant and Department of Finance projects that it'll be stagnant going forward into the near future, as well as class size policy, such as class size reduction efforts. When engaging the teachers' apply, I eluded to the number of credentials that are issued in a given year. If you look over the past 15 years, we've seen about a 70% decline in the number of credentials issued in California, but I want to stress that this was largely tracking a decrease in the number of hires the districts were making.",0.0
False,,"Basically, as fewer jobs were available, fewer teachers were entering the market. Other key sources of supply to consider are teachers who re-enter the work force and what we see is that various studies have estimated that about a quarter of all new hires are teachers who are returning to the work force after a leave of absence. Other, and the final key source of supply to consider is that of out of state recruitment and if we look over the past, basically over the life of Proposition 98 we see that about 20 percent of us teachers that California hires in any given year come from out of state prepared programs.",0.0
False,,"The final aspect of the market that I want to discuss is that of teacher turnover and various national studies have estimated that turnover stands about 15% of the teachers leave their jobs in a given year. About half of these teachers leave the profession all together while the other half switch school. So taking all this into account, we asked what is the overall evidence for market shortages? And while we do note that there is a current imbalance between the number of credentials being produced versus the number of hires the districts are making, we believe that this will begin to correct itself over time.",0.0
False,,"We note that the CTC has issued more credentials in the past year than it had in the prior. In conversations with various credentialing programs, we're seeing increased enrollment in these programs. We're seeing districts engage in robust out-of-state recruitment efforts, all of which we believe will help booey the supply of teachers. However despite these perhaps promising trends, we note that research perennially shows that there are persistent shortage areas being in key subject areas of special education, science and math teachers.",0.0
False,,"As well as certain types of schools such as city center schools, schools with high percentages of a student body who are low income, and rural schools. On page four of the hand out we summarized a number of key policies that have been implemented and rather than going into each one I just want to point out that we've grouped these into eight key policy category areas. I'll let you look at these at a later time, in the interest of being efficient.",0.0
False,,"Finally, when looking at all of this, we believe that it's important for the state to focus on those perennial shortage areas because these tend to exist both in kind of tough labor markets for schools and also easier labor markets for schools where there's a greater supply of teachers. Those being those key subject areas and those certain types of schools.",0.0
False,,"As far as various policies that have been implemented, in terms of financial incentives, ongoing salary increases can be more effective than one time bonuses because, while they serve the purpose of attracting teachers to the schools Initially they can also be effective at keeping the teachers there. When it comes to financial aid models, which the state has implemented various formats in the past, research tends to, while both up front tuition grants and loan forgiveness programs can be effective, research tends to point to up front tuition grants as being a more effective model.",0.0
False,,"As far as Supporting outreach policies these can be very effective at keeping teachers in the workforce and getting them to the workforce. New teachers' support programs which we were just discussing in the prior issue such as new teacher induction programs could be very effective if they're individualized to the teacher and focus on a strong mentor relationship. As far as support programs for ongoing teachers, this is really where effective administrators come into play and it's crucial for these administrators to be able to gauge some of the issues that teachers experience to be able to talk and coach them through some of the workplace issues they encounter.",0.0
False,,"Finally, as I mentioned, California is a source of a lot of teachers from out of state as well as teachers who are not actively teaching Have recruited them and pulled them back into the profession and we believe this is a key strategy for addressing teacher shortages in the short-term. I do want to to stress though, when assessing all of these different policies, we really rely on a fragmented set of research papers as opposed to any kind of robust labor market analysis. That's because the state lacks a longitudinal teacher database, where we can track a teacher throughout the duration of their career.",0.0
False,,"While certain elements are collected at various state agencies, we don't have the kind of comprehensive, robust, and periodic research approach that would allow us to gauge exactly what the market looks like and the true benefit and conduct a true and effective do cost benefit of analysis of all the various shortage intervention policies that have been attempted. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Good afternoon Madame Chair, Members of the Committee. My name is Brian Stiger, I'm the director for the Los Angeles County Department of Consumer Affairs. Over the past year, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has taken a number of steps to lift people out of poverty, and address the problem of homelessness. Once, its action was to raise the minimum wage in the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. On September 15th, 2015, the board passed a minimum wage ordinance that comes into effect on July 1st, 2016.",0.0
False,,"The ordinance requires employers with more than 26 employees to raise the minimum wage up to $10.50 an hour, which will then increase annually for the next four years, ultimately being at $15 an hour. For businesses that have 25 or fewer employees, that action is deferred for one year. In addition to passing the minimum wage ordinance the board took the necessary steps to ensure that employers actually pay minimum wage to workers as required by the ordinance and this is important because wage theft is widespread in Los Angeles County and one of the most common wage theft violations is failure to pay the minimum wage.",0.0
False,,"And the months leading up to the minimum wage adoption, we heard testimony from a number of wage theft victims during public hearings and all the way throughout Los Angeles County. As the Senator said we learn that victims of wage theft are disproportionately women and people of color. Senate Bill 1342 essentially helps the Department of Consumer Affairs investigate complaints of which theft and more importantly, it helps us recover wages that are owed to workers to help them remain out of poverty and potentially lose their homes and I would specifically ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Good afternoon, I'm Kelly Brooks. I'm speaking today on behalf of the California State Association of Counties. We are very supportive of the Medical 2020 waiver overall, and I've been asked today to speak specifically about the whole person care component.",0.0
False,,I think it's noteworthy for you all to recognize that the Whole Person Care pilot is the first time that a California waiver has included a project aimed at addressing the social determinants of health. I think there's been a lot of really good thought and discussion about how to address the triple aim and achieve better health outcomes for the varying populations within the Medic Help Program.,0.0
False,,"And I think the Whole Person Care pilot recognizes that no one entity is going to do this by themselves. The Medi-Cal Managed Care plans can't do it alone, the County Health Agencies aren't going to do it alone, County Specialty Mental Health plans can't do it by themselves, and certainly the providers in the community can't either. It really is a partnership across public and private systems, thinking about, how do we improve the overall of our communities?",0.0
False,,I think the pilots are a really great opportunity to sort of build on the local innovation that we know is already out there. I think counties are very comfortable in thinking about how to go forward with whole person care because of the successes of the low income health program and it's predecessor that covered initiatives.,0.0
False,,"I think we have a pretty high degree of interest amongst counties, both rural, urban, suburban, counties with hospitals, counties without hospitals and thinking about how this might be tailored to meet their local needs and address some really vexing issues around low income populations.",0.0
False,,"I would be remiss if I did not thank the Department of Healthcare Services for all their work leading to Medi-Cal 2020, whole person care evolved from the stakeholder process, it was not initially on DHCS's radar, but I think through really good collaboration and discussion, this became part of the final waiver package.",0.0
False,,"And they did a ton of work on thinking about the housing component, which is in the whole person care waiver. I'd also like to note that CSAC, along with CAPH, the County Behavioral Health Directors, the County Welfare Directors, the County Health Executives, the Local Health Plans of California, SEIU California, and the Corporation for Supportive Housing have all been working in collaboration to think about from the brain child of whole person care to, sort of, what it looks like through the waiver development.",0.0
False,,"And we continue to meet and offer learning collaboratives and opportunities for localities to figure out, okay, how would this work for us locally? What are the questions that we need answered so that we can go forward and send the applications? So I think one of the things that is really important to the Whole Person Care Pilot is the opportunity to build something that is sustainable beyond the five years of the waiver in thinking about the opportunity to reach across systems so that we're not so siloed to think about some infrastructure that could be put in place that potentially lasts beyond the five years, to think about how we share data across systems and how that becomes a way of doing business so that we're coordinating care in real time, so that we're getting as much information as possible about some of the really high users of multiple systems.",0.0
False,,"I think that is part of the incentive for folks to think about participating, is really this opportunity on the data and infrastructure side.",0.0
False,,I also think there is a lot of interest frankly because of the health income component. I think this opportunity aligns with a lot of discussions that are happening locally about how to address homelessness in their communities. It's a very interesting time with the Legislature and your interests and then the Assembly's interest as well in addressing housing and homelessness issues. And so I think this has people thinking about how housing and health fit together.,0.0

Obviously probably housing supports and thinking about maybe using Peer navigators or peer supports in a different way to ensure people are getting to appointments and getting their needs met. Another piece of the Whole Person Care pilot is an evaluation component.,0.0
False,,"So the early years are going to be focused on sort of getting infrastructure up and running. But we're going to have to demonstrate that we're improving health outcomes. And so this is something that I think we're going to end up having other states looking to California, because we may be a national leader in this area.",0.0
False,,"And certainly CMS is going to be looking to make sure that California is meeting it's goals. I think the last thing I would just mention, I do think that whole person care is an opportunity to leverage some of the policy discussions that are going on perhaps around the drug Medi-Cal waiver. How these things might fit together, what the department is talking about in terms of implementing health homes in 2017, and so I think this is really an interesting policy time for us and and the health community to think about how some of these projects may fit together to improve overall community health. Thank you for having me.",0.0
False,,"I agree with Ms. Cantwell on the data piece. I think it's going to be challenging to figure out all the data sharing agreements that need to be in place for whole person care amongst different entities public and private, which direction the information can go and sort of figuring out, okay what can we do under state law? What can we do under federal law? And where do we have some room to be creative about the rules? It's not just with whole person care.",0.0

False,,"I understand that the bill builds on an area of existing law. So that niche with charter cities that have some control already, according to statute, over school districts. But by extending it this way we're really pre-supposing that a non-educational entity is better equipped than a local educational entity to make decisions about the best way to teach civic engagement,",0.0
False,,"and that is just something that we would fundamentally disagree with. Secondly, because the bill specifically authorizes the noneducational entity to pass along the additional costs, but the election, which will be significant to the local educational agency, it's also empowering this charter city to make decisions about our budget,",0.0
False,,"to impose things, so without question, there would be resources taken away from what we would otherwise spend on our local educational. Excuse me, our local control accountability plans. Meaning the educational goals that we want are students to attain.",0.0
True,toxicity,"Another area of inequity is that the bill effectively creates the three classes of voters the State of California. Right now, we have one class of voter, and we still deal with issues of voter confusion. This bill would create your full-fledged, 18 year old voter. It would create your 16 and 17 yea old who can vote in some elections, and it would create your 16 and 17 year old who cannot vote.",0.0872833

And as a mental health provider, I can tell you that one of the biggest indicators for somebody to turn around their episode, is the more quickly they can get services, the better chances they are of a better recovery.",0.0
False,,"So, what we're talking about here is developing a registry, a real time registry, where there are open psychiatric beds. And I know there is some opposition to this, and this will not in total solve the problem, but we can't just keep waiting for the magic bullet while we don't take the things that are available to us already within our grasp.",0.0

False,,"So like I said, a bed registry is only one tool that will help. It will give psychiatrist and other mental health professionals a tool to help when there are crisis and need emergency care, when patients are in incredibly vulnerable or fragile states, their condition may be deteriorating rapidly, particularly if they are in danger of harming themselves or somebody else.",0.0
False,,"It's really important that they get into a bed as quickly as possible to start treatment. Currently, when someone needs a bed, the healthcare provider will start calling around. And I worked as a LCSW in a couple of hospital emergency rooms and I could tell you when crisis come in and if you don't have a bed in your facility and you try to find another one, it's just a panacea of trying to call and see where there's a bed, see where there's an open bed.",0.0
False,,"When you call, you can't get through. So this will create a registry where everyday in real time, it is updated, who has a bed, what is that bed for medically fragile, is that bed a lock unit, what are the parameters around that bed. So when somebody is coming in with an emergency, you need to place them quickly, you have way more knowledge and awareness of where that bed is open.",0.0
False,,"You still have to make those calls and say, alright, we have a patient, can you accept them? But it cuts down tremendously on the time, if you already have the data in front of you that says where are there beds open and available. The one state that has tried it in Virginia, but they did it more of a voluntary program.",0.0
False,,"And again if its voluntary its not going to be as robust as it will be if its mandatory. That created more problems than it fixed so that's why we're, rather than starting as a statewide rollout, to try it as a pilot first with counties. The Bay Area counties have already started a very integrated network, so they seem like the appropriate ones to start it off with.",0.0
False,,"Again, we don't say that this will fix everything. I am committed to working on mental health during my time here. This is one more step, provides one more tool, dealing with people when they are at their most fragile, sitting in emergency rooms. With me today, I have Randall Hagar from the Psychiatric Association and from the Steinberg Institute and Dr. Moline as an emergency room physician.",0.0
False,,"Well, that was the initial bill, Mr. Ridley-Thomas. The initial bill was to do it statewide. And as you can see from the private hospitals, you don't see the public hospitals up here objecting, from the private hospitals there is some resistance because change is hard.

We are a very large state, though we're close to 40 million people, to start with a pilot in an area that already has a high degree of integrated care.",0.0
False,,"Correct. It's a registry they already use. This will be just an added column. This is, again, one agency and one organization that provides this is already doing business in the Bay Area counties and has already helped them set up the registry for all the other issues that they.",0.0
False,,"And also in the State of Virginia, they have a different mental health system than we do. Ours, people with severe psychiatric conditions are in state hospitals, they're sort of out of the loop which is not the case of Virginia. So there was a lot more moving parts, and the system was not updated in the way that we imagined it should be updated.",0.0
False,,"Thank you. And yes, our intention is to continue to work on this. So I think people have been covered all the points and I will say as I said in the beginning and also as a researcher and a clinician. Nobody is questioning that there aren't enough beds. We need more beds but to not do anything while we wait for more beds is also is a, it's untenable.",0.0

False,,"Pathways are voluntary programs aimed at helping providers ensure their patients get clinically appropriate quality care with minimal side effects. Let me emphasize, they are voluntary. At least the voluntary pathways developed by health plans, do not interfere with doctors, deciding which therapy they believe is best for the patient. They also do not interfere with innovation or clinical trials.",0.0
False,,They're simply one of many ways in which the healthcare system is trying to develop more evidence-based treatment programs and options. CAHP opposes AB 2209 because it unfairly singles out health plans and subjects their pathways and programs to unneeded government regulation. It assumes a need for statutory guidelines without imposing those same standards on other pathways that are developed by other entities.,0.0

Why should only voluntary health plan pathways be subject to the standards of this bill? The proponents themselves stated in their opening testimony",0.0
False,,"that they believe that the health plan pathways should be held up to the same standards as other guidelines. Well, then if that's the case, then everybody's pathway should be subject to the standards of this bill, whether it's a health plan, drug distributor or a medical system. Isn't it reasonable to think that a pathway developed by a drug distributor might prevent access to clinical trials of a competitor drug?",0.0
False,,"It's not clear at all why the standards proposing this bill would not be applied to pathways developed by others.

False,,"And we have been much more proactive, but, A formal investigation from the Bureau is completely different than a suspension of Title IV or a different process. Ms. Wenzel, any thoughts on that?",0.0
False,,"So the fact sheet on these regulations were pursuant to 2296 Bullock. And these should have been implemented a long time ago. This was one of my biggest priorities to promulgate.

And bake those into the policies that we're starting to see now.",0.0

False,,"Correct, what happens is not withstanding an investigation whether or not that institution is an investigation and unfortunately, we're not privy to share the specifics if a school is in investigation or not.

False,,So we do appreciate the changes the department's brought forward. We do think there are several important principles that are still missing in the language that we'd like to continue to work on. One of them is the historical rate disparity issue which was mentioned. Now there is greater protections for startup programs.,0.0
False,,"As Ms. Cantwell said, it's very hard to start a program. They typically lose money. We actually think the proposal could make that worse, which is not what we'd like to see to expand PACE. We do support a hold harmless of some kind.",0.0
False,,"This is a very uncertain area, I think Miss Cantwell acknowledged that. Nobody knows what's going to happen to the rates. We think, for that very reason, there should be a protective provision in place at least transitionally to ensure that this does not result in adverse rate of impacts.",0.0
False,,"Many of the PACE organizations have built their programs, their expansions, their commitments, their capital investment on the current rate structure. And it would really undermine that if the rates were to change dramatically. We also, and this is the last point I'm going to make. We really think the rate methodology needs to recognize the value of what PACE does.",0.0
False,,"And I think that Ms. Cantwell did touch on it, but PACE is all about keeping people out of nursing homes and hospitals who are very, very frail. The rate methodology as it's evolving, we're not sure what continued to incentivize that. There's really no mechanism that would give a PACE program credit if you will, if they did a better job even in, terms of keeping people out. We think that's maybe a generic problem with managed care rate setting, but we're really troubled in a value based program to see that imported into the PACE arena.",0.0

False,,"Thank you for your answers. Thank you, Mr. Stone. I'm sure as a licensed pharmacist, you probably know a lot about this. I would suggest that the LAO seek, if you need any expertise on that, to talk to Mr. Stone. But most importantly, I want you to know the reason you're getting a lot of both fiscal and policy questions is because both the Senate and the Assembly really rely on your impartial analysis to give us the best answers.",0.0
False,,"So, that's why you probably, I know we promised we only have fiscal questions, but you probably got bombarded with a lot of policy questions, because it's important. And so, I'll end with and I just want you to find out. I don't believe in reinventing the wheel. And if there are other states that have implemented this policy, we really should look at their findings.",0.0
False,,"And find out what they've learned, so that we can let the public be more informed where people have started not having or abolishing the death penalty. What have the impact have been over the first year, first five years or whatever time. And obviously, fiscally, I think some members have asked about the crime rates and other things.",0.0
False,,"I think it's really important if we all ready have a case study all ready started that we need to get that information. I would ask for you to get that for this Committee, for both committees. And the other thing and this is really important for me on the fiscal side, possibly the devil's in the details.",0.0
False,,"And as we Learned from Prop 47 as we started looking at what the savings are, we are $100 million in difference between the LAO and the Finance Department.

False,,"I think we can do a lot better than that. We can probably drill down to what things we won't do anymore, like we said, double the guards, solitary confinement or segregation. We should be able to find those costs and what those costs actually are.",0.0
False,,"So that if this does come to pass, the last thing that will have to happen is to see the same budgets at the same number and we're supposed to have savings, because we didn't accurately define where those savings were going to come from.",0.0

False,,"One innocent person, on one hand, you have the opponents who basically say that if we have someone on death row, they're not able to go out and commit another crime. And for them to get out again, and just really to kill one person Is really heinous. And it's something that this society should look at as being intolerable.",0.0
False,,"Whether it's a law enforcement officer, individuals that would go to that extreme, we really need to look at that strongly. And look at special circumstances. I definitely can empathize with that and also with the victims, because one innocent person that is killed in that, I think is just horrendous.",0.0
True,toxicity,"While the proponents on the other side will tell you that one innocent person that is killed on death row is equally heinous. And if you go before, not necessarily a jury of your peers, and the prosecutor is white, your defense attorney's white, the judge is white, the jury is white and you're an African American and you're sentenced to death because maybe the jury may be more prone to kill an African American.",0.35108453
False,,"That's equally heinous and difficult. I think that's what ultimately, when this goes out to the public, they're going to weigh in what I'd call the extreme of worst case scenarios, they've gotta weigh. And I think it's going to be a very difficult decision for them.",0.0
False,,"But it's something that we need to continue to grapple with and ultimately we get a chance to make a decision on how we feel as a state and how we're going to move forward. I don't know if there's any compromise to that, we're going to hear more testimony in the afternoon on some other initiatives.",0.0
False,,But hopefully you can see how difficult this is when you're trying to protect what I call the one innocent. It's just extremely difficult to do that. And I think that's very true and that's why I think that it's admirable the State of California when they did the study of decades that no innocent person has ever been executed in the State of California and the protections in place are so extensive.,0.0
False,,"And doesn't mean we couldn't make a mistake, I think everybody here, that'd be horrifying if any of us, no one supports that. But I think there are protections in place to make sure that doesn't happen. And the voters knowing that is in place still support the death penalty.",0.0
False,,"And we're not going back and forth, but I would submit that we probably don't have any evidence that an innocent person may have been put to death, once someone's put to death as some of my colleagues on here have said they can no longer one commit another murder, but subsequently, we're not going out and trying to prove that they're innocent after they've been put to death.",0.0
False,,"So, there's not a whole lot of energy either way to prove or disprove it. That's the challenge for what we're going to have, to make a decision when we go to the polls on this. So I want to thank everyone for testifying. I especially want to thank you for staying within the time limit.",0.0
False,,"I will tell you, this has been a very good panel, too.

False,,"Good Morning, Mr. Chair and Committee Members, Judy Heiman from the Legislative Analyst's Office. Regarding the 75 million general purpose base increase, we recommend adoption. We think given the additional resources available at May revision it makes sense to give the community college districts some flexible funding they can use towards their highest priorities.",0.0
False,,"We wanted to bring up a related issue, related to enrollment growth, that is not in the governor's May revision proposal. His proposal has no change in enrollment levels from the January budget. But apportionment reports that we've received just this week indicate the system is falling below the May",0.0
False,,"revision enrollment levels by about 12,000 full-time equivalent students. We recommend reducing the current year, 2015-16 enrollment growth funding by 60 million to recognize this new information. And then reducing funding by the same amount in the budget year, just to carry forward that lower base, while still maintaining 2% enrollment growth from that lower base.",0.0
False,,That would ensure sufficient funding next year in the event that community colleges are able to begin seeing more robust enrollment.,0.0
False,,"We would also recommend using budget year funds for one time priorities to build more of a cushion against potential declines in the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee in the next few years. Regarding the Online Education Initiative, the proposal for $20 million to accelerate progress, the initiative is well under way, has made good progress on a number of its component projects.",0.0
False,,And we believe the Chancellor's Office could significantly accelerate that movement with the proposed May revision funding. Before approving the proposed funding however we recommend that you ask the Chancellor's Office to identify the specific deliverables that you can expect to see as a result of the proposed funding.,0.0
False,,"For example, how many online exchange courses are they planning to pilot in the next few years, and how would this funding increase that number? Regarding the changes to the Strong Workforce Program, we recommend approving the substantive changes proposed.",0.0
False,,But we recommend modifying the proposal to remove a new requirement that LAO approve the proposed funding allocations. We don't believe that that's an executive branch function. We think it would be appropriate for us to review the proposed allocation and notify you of any concerns we identify.,0.0
False,,"But we shouldn't be involved in actually approving an administrative allocation. Regarding the Zero-Textbook-Cost Degree Program policy proposal,",0.0
False,,"we recommend approving the May revision changes. Several of the Governor's proposed changes are consistent with recommendations that we made in January, and others provide helpful clarifications. We further recommend requiring the Chancellor's Office to coordinate the program with related initiatives in the state such as an ongoing open educational resource adoption incentive grant for CSU and community colleges.",0.0
False,,"And then as you'll hear in a moment, we recommend you consider linking this program with efforts to provide free course materials for state inmates who are enrolled in community college classes. We recommend that you adopt the Governor's proposed increase in the Full-time Student Success Grant to include Cal Grant C recipients.",0.0
False,,This also reflects an option we suggested you consider in January if you're interested in increasing financial aid for CTE students. Community colleges were able to implement the program very quickly after you approved it last year for Cal Grant B students. And they should have no difficulty adding Cal Grant C students and expanding the program also quickly.,0.0
False,,We recommend adopting the proposal to use special fund monies for their intended purpose under the EEO program. And we also recommend adopting the governor's May revision proposal for adult education technical assistance.,0.0
False,,"And the additional one-time funding could help them come together and could help all consortia improve their practices and outcomes through better coordination, professional development, and targeted technical assistance. The proposal to provide digital instructional materials for inmates, we recommend you reject. We have a number of outstanding questions regarding this proposal.",0.0
False,,"It didn't include sufficient information for you to really evaluate it well. Just for example, the community college system's Inmate and Reentry Education Program reports that very few faculty have chosen to use content on the existing CDCR eReaders for their courses. Some of them prefer using printed materials that inmates can actually take back to their cells to do homework.",0.0
False,,"And also, unlike the eTextbooks that CDCR has purchased or actually rented with earlier funds, books don't expire at the end of the academic term. So to the extent that you're interested in considering this initiative, we recommend that you direct CDCR and the Chancellor's Office to work together on bringing something back to you next year that's more fleshed out.",0.0
False,,"And in the meantime, you could consider amending the governor's Zero-Textbook-Cost Degree proposal to include in its priorities, the creation of free open educational resources for courses that are offered to student inmates and that would work on CDCR's eReaders.",0.0
False,,"And finally, we recommend adopting the proposed augmentations for the technology infrastructure proposal. We think the TTIP program has developed a solid plan for using these funds to expand Internet capacity across the system as it prepares to",0.0

False,,I was just going to mention the same thing. It's not currently in the language. Campuses that we've talked to have indicated that the college stores are important partners in this process and should be included.,0.0
False,,"Thank you, Marc Mcdonald, McCallum Group on behalf of a number of local community college districts, including Los Rios, Los Angeles, and San Diego. We support, first of all, the base allocation increase, particularly with COLA going to zero. This is critical since our costs locally are still going up. We support the money for the deferred maintenance and instructional equipment.",0.0
False,,"We haven't passed a state bond since 2006. Our facilities desperately need this money to be maintained. We do have concerns, as the Chancellor's office indicated, about money in Prop 98 going towards Cal Grants.",0.0
False,,"Finally, under the strong workforce proposal,",0.0
False,,"the move from 60 to 40% has been good. But we would still encourage the 70, 30 split from local to regional. Also, we oppose the 60% cap on ongoing funding, that districts can only spend 60% of the local money on ongoing funds.",0.0
False,,"Also, we support the proposal to expedite the curriculum process. Thank you. Thank you.",0.0
False,,Ideally to other one time priorities. Certainly the current year funding would need to go to one time priority such as maintenance.,0.0
False,,"Although many of the consortia have successfully transitioned to the new model for delivering adult education, some of them are continuing to struggle with developing the relationships and structures they need to collaborate effectively.",0.0
False,,"Thank you. I'll just quickly say good afternoon, and welcome to the hearing on the initiative to reform the death penalty. The death penalty reform and savings act of 2016. As many of you know, in 2013, Senator Anderson had a bill that was substantially similar, in many aspects, to this proposed to initiative.",0.0
False,,"So some of the aspects of the initiative may be familiar to some of the Committee Members. As far as procedure for the hearing, the format obviously will be the same as this morning. We'll hear fiscal analysis from the Legislative Analysts Office followed by testimony from both sides, and finally public comment. So I just want to again, I recognize that the death penalty is a decisive,",0.0
False,,"and often an emotional issue, and I remind everyone to be very respectful of divergent views.",0.0
False,,"And I guess with that, we will invite our first panel to come up.",0.0
False,,"Hi. I have a question, really, about process and how to estimate costs, because I've always said where the rubber meets the road is implementation. And one of the frustrating things about a Proposition we just did,",0.0
False,,"Prop 47, in it, I would say it had kind of a poison pill, where the estimates for what the savings to the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund would be based on one person's or one entities' determination, which was Finance.",0.0
False,,"And there was no checks and balances, looked like there might not even be any input from the Legislature, so, if the Finance Department says it's only $29 million in savings, that's what it is. If we think, we being the Legislature, think it's $129, in some ways, they can tell you to go pound sand. And that's very frustrating because I don't think that's what the voters intended it to be.",0.0
False,,"I think they intended to have some checks and balances. So I'm really concerned about this. Because while we're talking about money in one Proposition, this one we're actually talking about people's lives and",0.0
False,,"putting it in the hands of the bureaucracy, which I'm very respectful of and CDCR and ensuring that the court system are all working together collaboratively to make sure that we don't make any mistakes and I'm extremely concerned and I don't know if you can answer this today.",0.0
False,,"Are there any things in this measure that we look back a year from now and we may have to do another initiative or we have to make some corrections within the Legislature to fix something, because we have not fully figured out how to implement it.",0.0
False,,"I mean, the discussions that we're having now, even asking you about cost, you're like we're waiting for CDCR to give us or we're waiting for the courts to give us or we're waiting for, it can't be determined until you actually put it in place. I think that's a little scary and a little frustrating.",0.0
False,,"And so I don't know if you can, and I know we don't have a lot of time, I don't know if you can answer now. If one thing I can ask is at least do an analysis so that we know that the intent of this initiative is one thing. But is there enough information in here, hopefully there's no poison pills in here to derail this,",0.0
False,,"and it turns into something else that we all regret later. And so that there's enough safeguards in here to ensure that whatever the voters vote on, whatever that they want, they intended to vote on, that they actually get that. So, and I think you know what I mean about unintended consequences from Prop 47, because you did the analysis.",0.0
False,,"And so I'm very concerned that, not only this initiative, but even the other one we heard earlier this morning, that we scrub it to ensure that we don't have any problems later.",0.0
False,,"Okay, Senator Leno, okay.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, I just want to as someone that represents south Los Angeles. Where unfortunately I do have a portion of the rolling neighborhood crips territory in my district.

False,,The social workers are unable to kind of give them information about the second exemption. So we appreciate the funding that's there for but we just kind of still are hoping that the second exemption kind of gets out there and the providers are notified. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Hi, Kristina Bas Hamilton representing UDW AFSCME local 3930. I want to speak in support of what my colleague mentioned regarding notices. I think that what we're seeing in all practicality is that the social workers who manage",0.0

False,,"And so, for the most part, people are maybe hearing about it through word of mouth or through their labor organization, which isn't a bad thing. And we obviously want to service our members, but we do think that for folks who are not knowing about it, but maybe eligible, it does do a disservice.",0.0
False,,"One of the requests we've made to this Committee, and we have submitted trailer bill to that effect, is that there should be some type of mailing to some subset of the population using some targeted criteria and  too that can say these are the most likely people.",0.0
False,,"And at the very least and not a million to those folks. The other thing that we would like to see is a due process. Because, right now, the way that it works is if you want a second exemption, which is special circumstances, you have to make your case to your county social worker.",0.0
False,,"Again, we have issues with county social workers and workload issues, but if your county social worker say's no, I don't think that you deserve the exemption, there's no recourse. Actually, the De facto recourse that's occurring, because this is happening, is that",0.0
False,,"the provider's coming to us as their union and saying can you please help us? And we're sort of facilitating an appeal informally to the department, and the department has certainly been very open and helpful.",0.0
False,,"But that's not a due process that people deserve, which is someone else to review the case and say actually you do qualify for an exemption. And here's actually a perfect example. We have cases of providers who have hired a second provider to",0.0
False,,"meet the hour need above 360, but then, being denied the exemption because there's a second provider in the home. So the social worker's saying, well you don't really need the exemption. But they hired the second provider in order to not have the client lose services for the hours that they themselves couldn't work.",0.0
False,,"So, what we're seeing is a tremendous need for education and training to the social workers. Some of whom, believe it or not, still don't even know that these exemptions exist.

However, we would note that this bill authorizes the PUC to contract with an independent third party to evaluate wildfire mitigation plans or to conduct the audit and inspections authorized by this bill, and to require electrical corporations to reimburse any related expenses. Consequently, we think that PUC's estimate may be overstated if third party contractors are utilized in the long-term.",0.0

False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Where to begin? Begin with some statements that were made with respect to the grounds for obtaining a license. Representations were made that heroin dealers could get a license under the AUMA. That is simply not true. In order to believe that one would have to believe that Lori Ajax, the head of the bureau, would knowingly give a license to somebody who is a heroin dealer. That is not true. The initiative simply says that a prior for certain drug related offenses is not automatically disqualified. If somebody's engaged in trafficking white China heroine, or cocaine or whatever the case may be, you can bet that they're engaged in other unlawful activities, tax evasion.",0.0
False,,"And what we definitely know is they're engaged in unlicensed sales of controlled substances. And so the conviction, the penal conviction, may not be automatically disqualified, but those other offenses are absolutely grounds that the administrative agency can deny a license on. So simply, this concern about heroin dealers getting licenses with respect is just simply not true.",0.0
False,,"Well, I think again we were trying to strike a careful balance between insuring that the regulators had the discretion in here. There's no question this provision gives the regulators the discretion to deny the license.",0.0
False,,"What we wanted to do was in a similar way to what was done in the medical legislation, give the regulators the ability to find that somebody has been rehabilitated. It is true we did not do it the exact same way, but the end result is no different. The regulators have the flexibility to look at a prior offense and determine whether or not somebody is sufficiently rehabilitated to have a license. And if they don't conclude that that's the case, they are not required to get a license. Nobody's entitled to a license.",0.0
False,,"Well, again, I feel like we're spending the time on controlled substance versus limitation to just marijuana. True enough it says, controlled substance, but we're forgetting that is the sole grounds. The simple existence of that one prior conviction in of itself is not solely disqualified, but those types of convictions rarely occur in isolation. Again, if somebody is selling a controlled substance without a license, that is grounds for denial of a license period. So I think again, without simply focusing on the terms solely is a little limiting, I would say.",0.0
False,,"Well, I did want to spend a moment if I may with respect to the Advisory Committee. I believe Mr. Lovell referred to it, as an opportunity for industry representatives to identify regulations that could be struck down and to essentially help lawyers to build their practices. I think if you actually read the text of 2614, you'll see something quite different. First of all, the Advisory Committee is very similar to the Advisory Committee under the medical legislation. You want to have an Advisory Committee, it makes sense to have an Advisory Committee as these regulatory agencies get up and running. You want to have, as the AUMA does. An Advisory Committee that helps provide guidance on best practices and guidelines that protect the public health, and safety. I'm on page 14.",0.0
False,,"While striking a balance and ensuring that the regulated environment doesn't impose unreasonably impractical barriers as to perpetuate and reduce, and eliminate the illicit market for marijuana.

False,,"Our office, assume our office's estimate of property taxes are about $385 $1 million, would result in $385 million in reduced general fund Obligation from Proposition 98.

False,,"And because of this proposal, raises some questions about how the state should prioritize funding. In this area versus many other potentially worthy areas of research. Our office suggested a few criteria the Legislature might want to consider.",0.0
False,,"In particular, is there a good argument that there is a lack of a federal and private activity in this area, and funding in this area that the state might need to play some role so that there is adequate funding here. A second consideration is whether or not this research would provide some type of benefit that is uniquely important to California and its residents.",0.0
False,,And I think based on these criteria we found it hard to justify providing funding for this particular area of research over many other potentially worthwhile Research ventures. We also had some concerns about sort of just the administration of the program.,0.0
False,,"In particular, the sort of lack of clarity on how some of the funds would be spent, particularly the administrative funds, which is potentially about a million and a half of the funding here. The use of those funds, the amount, and the number of staff that would fund, that has been fluctuating throughout our conversation with the administration.",0.0
False,,"And we're still, sort of, lacking some clarity about how that would be spent, so we have some concern there as well. Because of all this, we have recommended the Legislature reject this proposal, and the staff recommendation on this item is to reject.",0.0

False,,"Helen Christine with the LAO, so as you heard, you have a handout in front of you. If you turn to page one, we have a brief summary of the proposal. So in January, the Governor proposed 77 positions and $35 million from the general fund in 2016-17, and",0.0
False,,"that included 20 million in one-time spending on fire equipment. The proposal also includes a reduction in federal funds authority of $3.9 million, and we would note that this proposal includes 16 different components. So, there are a large number of components to the proposal.",0.0
False,,"Those are in five areas, fire response, disaster coordination, facilities, technology, and other activities that the department conducts. So as part of our February analysis, we reviewed the Governor's proposal and found that the department wasn't able to provide some of the details that would be necessary to assess the proposal and some of those individual components.",0.0

False,,"Excellent. So if we start with the fire apparatus and fleet replacement and augmentation, that's on page three.",0.0
False,,"The Governor's proposal was $20 million to purchase and additional 62 fire apparatus, basically, fire trucks. Our recommendation was to reject the proposal. We noted that the proposal was based largely on a 2004 Blue Ribbon Commission report. And it wasn't clear what the analytical basis of that report was, and it's also quite an old report, so we weren't sure that it was still valid.",0.0
False,,"And the department hadn't done its own independent analysis of the existing resources in terms of fire response, for example, what locals have, what other state agencies have. And they hadn't identified what the gaps are, in terms of those pieces of fire equipment.",0.0
False,,"So, it wasn't clear to us that they had justified that 62 additional apparatus is the correct number of additional apparatus or that they would be best positioned to be entity with those apparatus. Additionally, it wasn't clear where they would be located and how that would happen, as well. We'd recommend in rejecting the proposal.",0.0
False,,You'll note that the Committee staff recommendation is to approve $10 million for 27 of those apparatus.,0.0
False,,"So the administration's proposal was framed as both replacement and a new apparatus. We would note that the replacements, though, are needed because our understanding is that the department used funding that was typically available for replacing engines and actually used them over the last couple of years to purchase new engines.",0.0
False,,"Which is why they need some funding for replacement engines now because they used that funding elsewhere. So, but it's correct that that's what it's intended for. Okay.And then the next item I believe that you wanted to discuss was the fire and rescue branch staffing, which is very much related to the fire apparatus.",0.0
False,,"The governor's proposal was $2.5 million and 12 positions to support basically maintenance activities, as well as coordination activities with these new fire apparatus. We recommended rejecting this. We felt that the staffing wasn't needed for",0.0
False,,the new engines because we were recommending rejecting those new engines. And we didn't think the department provided a case to support that their existing staffing was insufficient to meet their needs for their existing workload. You'll note that the staff recommendation here was to approve $1.7 1 million,0.0
False,,"and 7 positions, which is consistent with the staff recommendation related to the number of engines. If you turn to page 4, sorry, if you turn to page 5, since we're skipping, I think, a couple of items. Statewide Disaster Programs.",0.0
False,,"This is one of several different pieces related to disaster coordination. And this one's actually particularly complex. You'll notice that there are actually five separate components of this proposal. In total, they add to $5 million in general fund increase.",0.0
False,,"And there's actually a reduction of $3.9 million in federal funds. There's also two positions that are proposed as part of this, this particular piece of the proposal. So I'll just walk you through the five components very quickly if I may. And they're actually within three different kind of sub-programs, if you will.",0.0
False,,"So it is a little bit complex. The first two are really related to recovery public assistance. And this is basically a program that the department uses to process disaster claims. And you'll see that the first one is an increase in general fund of about $3.5 million,",0.0
False,,"and it's a reduction of federal funds of about $3.1 million. The department's rationale for this was an increase in workload that's not eligible for federal dollars. And their two main reasons why this workload wouldn't be eligible, one is that the workload could be for state-only disasters, so basically disasters that weren't declared as Federal disasters by the Federal Government.",0.0
False,,"Also, in some cases there are Federal disasters, but the state hasn't been able to close out those disasters within an eight-year period. And if the state doesn't close them out within eight years, then they're no longer eligible for federal dollars. The second piece is $188,000 to address a backlog of state only claims.",0.0
False,,So there is some backlog of these claims. They're anticipating closing out that backlog over a three year period. The next two components are related to their hazard mitigation program. This is a program that creates and reviews hazard mitigation plans for both the state and local governments.,0.0
False,,So the first piece is another of these adjustments in state and federal funding. You'll note that it's about $1 million increase in state general fund that's proposed and about $1 million decrease in federal funds authority that administration has indicated that the reason for this is that they haven't had a consistent federal grants and,0.0
False,,"so they can't rely on federal grant money to fund these activities. And then the next piece is related to staffing. There are two positions that are proposed, largely for climate adaptation workload. Then the final component is-",0.0
False,,"Yeah, I believe there may be some additional costs in there. The proposal only spoke to the two positions that I'm aware of. The administration may have more details on that, but I believe the only thing that was described in the proposal was the two positions. And then the final component was related to the pre-disaster and flood mitigation program and",0.0
False,,"that's a program that awards grants for disaster planning and projects and that's actually more of a technical adjustment to realign. And it's actually a reduction in general fund spending of $222,000 to realign state and federal funding based on the actual match requirements of that grant program. So we just noted sort of overall that there wasn't a lot of detail.",0.0
False,,"We did recommend approving $188,000 in general funds to address that backlog. We certainly think if there's a backlog of these claims that they need to be addressed. However just overall in terms of those shifts between state funding and federal funding we didn't think the department was able to make a compelling case that this was really the appropriate state and federal funding next.",0.0
False,,"So for example for the recovery public assistance program we noted that this is actually a very large increase in their general fund support, about 65% increase for that program and it wasn't clear that the increase in workload, the new workload was that large. They didn't provide data to substantiate that and it wasn't also clear you know they've",0.0
False,,"seen just a tremendous backlog or redirection, all those things may have happened. We didn't receive any data that substantiated to that kind of increase to necessitate a $3.5 million increase in general funds. Similarly, with the hazard mitigation piece, that additional $1 million of state general fund, the administration indicated that that was needed because there wasn't consistent federal funding.",0.0
False,,"While this may be the case, where we ask for data on the past awards that the state had received. Actually, there was an increase in the last year or two, in terms of the amount, and it was just aggregated by state and local. So, we understand some of that, a large portion of that, or potentially all of it, may have gone to locals, but",0.0
False,,"it just wasn't clear to us that there's a reason why the state couldn't access those grant funds. So then we also noted just on those positions that it wasn't clear to us what role the department was going to have in terms of climate adaptation, and how those additional positions would be utilized. So we'd note also the staff recommendation was to approve the 188,000 in general funds.",0.0
False,,"And if you turn to page six, the regional response and readiness. This is also related to disaster coordination. The Governor's proposing $2 million in 13 positions. This group basically interacts with local, state, federal government related to various disasters.",0.0
False,,"Our recommendation was to reject this piece of the proposal as well. The department had some anecdotal evidence about increased threats driving this need. However, there wasn't any data that they were able to provide that really substantiated that, and the justification for these 13 positions. And then our rationale was very similar with the law enforcement branch staffing increase.",0.0
False,,"The governor's proposal was $1.7 million in six positions in this area, we recommended rejecting for very similar reasons. The staff recommendation was $1.1 million in four positions.",0.0
False,,"But then, maybe the last two items, where there's some difference you might want to address would be under the other category FEMA and emergency operations instance support training.",0.0
False,,"Sure. I can provide a brief summary of those. The Federal Emergency Management Program. It's on page 10 of your handout. So the Governor is proposing $700,000.00 and essentially what the Governor is proposing is replacing some",0.0
False,,inclined match that the states been providing with a cash match and this will allow them to perform additional activities. We're recommending rejecting this because they just didn't justify really what those activities were and why they were needed.

False,,"The Governor was proposing a 169,000 for additional specialized training. We recommended rejecting that as well.

False,,"Even with that particularly tough fire year, really it was a very small fraction of those requests that went unfilled.

False,,"Thank you, Mr Chair and members. Kenneth Capon with the Legislative Analyst's Office. The Senate package includes approximately $6 billion in new Proposition 98 funding compared to the funding level included in the 2015-16 Budget Act.",0.0
False,,"Of that amount, 3 and a half billion is related to increases from 2015-16 to 2016-17. And the remainder is related to increases in estimates of the prior year guarantee and some one time resources. The total minimum guarantee under the Senate package is $71.9 billion in 2016-17. And that reflects a 64 million increase over the May revision estimates for that year.",0.0
False,,"Of that increase, 54 million is related to your recent adoption of the LAO property tax estimates. Although the bulk of those estimates offset the state's general fund obligation, they also result in a small increase to the total Proposition 98 funding level. In addition, the Committee took action to adjust, or what we call rebench, the guarantee for the education component of the savings associated with Proposition 47 and that increases the guarantee by an additional $10 million.",0.0

False,,"So the specific differences for K-12 schools include $200 million on a one time basis for college readiness block grants. This is funding that schools would use to prepare students to be eligible for post-secondary institutions, as well as to increase the four year graduation rate.",0.0
False,,"So that might be used on such activities as counseling, or professional development, or instructional materials.

False,,"I think there were 22 applications that weren't funded in that program, and so the Senate package would redirect money toward that purpose.

False,,"Sure, so, as far as the difference there, I think the Senate package is paying out a little bit less in the mandate backlog.

False,,"I guess I'm looking for your guidance as to what is appropriate for us in terms of reporting back about a vendor. There's a lot of projects we do in the state where the vendors are very visible. And if it's a failure rate, everybody knows it's a failure, and that's part of the public record.

Mr. Chairman, I was wondering if we could ask the administration to in light of this potential legal threat to the cap in trade spending What is the contingency plan in case the judgment goes against the administration and our ability to assess this fee? What alternatives do you think are going to be available to us if we spend this money?",0.0
False,,"Right and I'm not an expert on litigation, but I thought that part of the challenge is the ability, the authority of the administration to actually assess this fee or tax or however you're going to interpret it. So it's not really necessarily just about how you spend the money, but whether or not you, we have exceeded our authorization in assessing that fee or tax, how you define it. Is that also part of the litigation?",0.0
False,,"My question is, does the administration have a contingency plan in case we were to lose that litigation, even though you have a high confidence level and I appreciate that. Is there a contingency plan that if we spend this money, then what do we do if we were to lose that case?",0.0
False,,"Right, but how much money is at risk to date if you allowed this spending to go forward, how much money now is at risk were we to lose that case? I understand your point which is that we're not spending at all. But, how much have we spent and how much if you add on to what we're proposing?",0.0
False,,Do you think we've spent $1 billion to date?,0.0
False,,"Right, but I'm talking about what we have spent and we were required to pay it back. So it sounds like you're saying it is about 4 billion through the end of this next fiscal year that we would have at risk. Is that correct?",0.0

False,,"Certainly that's always a possibility. I would note, however, that with these particular projects there is quite a bit of uncertainty about the specifics of a project. So one of the potential downsides to doing that is that It might sort of reduce the amount of oversight you have normally through the budget process.",0.0
False,,"Normally, you just approve the 16-17 amounts, then the administration would come forward in the next year, and then they will ask for an additional appropriation.

To be proud means you refuse to be ashamed, you refuse to deny who you are.",0.0

Political dialogue and push back to the LGBT visibility and expanded rights, things like marriage equality, equal protections, laws about non discrimination.

You talk to any law enforcement officer, DEA, they have crime guns all the time where the first thing the criminal does when they steal a gun is they cut out the serial number.

False,,"Thank you Mr. Chairman, good morning. A couple comments to make and questions. First, I was pleased to see the $35 million appropriated to the California State Universities with focus on 2 and 4 year graduation rates.",0.0
False,,"As we all know, this wonderful University system does such great work in accessibility and affordability and quality. But in the area of student success, four year completion, it's unfortunately very, very low. And I'm pleased to see us and the administration joined together to enhance the budget in this fashion. My question is what are our expectations in regard to how the money will be used. Is there anything that's been put forward to clarify that $35 million and how it can be put to this good important use.",0.0
False,,"The worry is that certainly there's a good argument to be made that we have under invested in the CSU over many years now. And that there are many things that the institution needs to do better. And they are undertaking a lot of different initiatives to try to do that. Whether its hiring more full time faculty or you could even argue pay rises is a way to attract quality faculty or retain quality faculty could be connected to, a student retention or student success or student graduation effort.",0.0
False,,So I do think that. And that's a challenge because I think that there are many members of this panel that would like to see us supplementing the state universities even more than what's here.,0.0
False,,In fact I think this is significantly under-budgeted to what they have asked us of in the course of the budget hearings this spring. And so it is going to be a challenge given that it is an under invested system to look specifically in this area of graduation initiative and identify why this fits. And that we should expect that that is going to be an allocation that's just going to hit that sweet spot to make it so much better.,0.0
False,,"So another question is that we, is the allocation that we are making to the state universities unallocated to the extent that when the trustees put forward their budget to us, they had broken it down in terms of where they thought these additional monies that they had requested would be spent. My first part of my question is the allocation side of it.",0.0
False,,"And the second part of the question that they have recently negotiated new faculty salary agreements. Faculty salary agreements that are going to put pressure on the general fund. I'm not clear how that's being paid for. And so is there anything in this budget that helps in that circumstance, so those are two part questions.",0.0
False,,"Okay, well I think that's a big challenge for them. Especially since they still haven't got back to where they were five or six years ago, in terms of state funding. And I appreciate what a challenge that's going to be given inflationary demands, and salary increases, and all the rest. One final clarification, and I know there's been new practice in how we fund capital outlay at the state universities. Is that a whole different trailer bill, not spoken to here in this one? Is that correct?",0.0
False,,"Okay. So then maybe for its absence I'll make one brief comment, Mr. Chairman, which is that this change in how we find capital outlay is a very unfortunate change that the Legislature and administration made. It basically says that, given the significant capital allied needs of the State Universities, that they now have to use their existing operating budget to pay for any new debt obligation that they want to undertake to restore or rebuild these vast array of facilities that have been created by the taxpayers.",0.0
False,,"All of us, for decades in the building of that institution and so, they have to now make a choice to borrow themselves. And to pay for it out of their operating versus the old way that had been in place for decades, which is that the University would come to us with the capital needs a new library, a science building that's breaking down and we would make it a choice to fund it or not. And the whole general fund would have the under obligation and that now is changed now.",0.0
False,,"So, we are not seeing those capital needs here, because now they have to take it out of everything else that we provide to them. And that's it, that's I think very unfortunate. So in it's absence my comment is now made. I would hope that we would at some point have an opportunity to revisit that, because it means that now we're going to put on the students. And the University, the infrastructure that the taxpayers of California in their wisdom have provided for more than 50 years.",0.0
False,,That is deteriorating and that should be an obligation that we all undertake. Not just the students; their families and the institution themselves.,0.0
False,,"Mr Chairman. Just to share some thoughts on the points that Senator Pavley's made. I know that's the narrative that's discussed and certainly in many cases, it's true in terms of obligations on kids. But here's a factoid for you.",0.0
False,,"Last fall, only 13% of the students at the CSU were taking less than 12 units. Okay, only 13%, 87% were taking 12 units or more and about 35% were taking 15 units or more. On track to graduate in four years.",0.0
False,,"So, there's a narrative about the CSU and part of it is true about the diversity of kids and the different challenges that they face. But we have kids going to our universities that do want to get through. Hundreds of thousands of them and they're not able to get through. They are not able to get their classes, they're redirected in a way.",0.0

False,,"By him referring to him personally, somehow it involved into illegal and shady operations and I don't think that's appropriate. And I also think it's healthy to characterize the motivations of anyone that's coming before us, certainly the Chamber of Commerce.

False,,"I never, thank you Senator. I never said, it was illegal conduct. What I will say is that the judge ordered that, that agreement, that reinsurance participation plan was null and void.",0.0
False,,Because it was not filed with the Department of Insurance. And that the Commissioner's decision and as of Monday of this week. Was to reinforce the notion that in a presidential decision that if it is not filed with the department. Especially this particular situation of Shasta Linen case that it is null and void.,0.0
False,,"Senator on that point, I would just note that we just started talking about this concept, a little bit ago. And I think we would be intrigued in pursuing that it wouldn't necessarily remove our kind of philosophical opposition. Because we do think that the line is pretty bright right now. But what you're referring to I think is what we would call sort of file-in-use situation in certain circumstances where it would be filed with us.",0.0

False,,"Robert and Bryan, thank you both. My question is, is that, does anything that we're doing in this proposed bill affect the ability of an injured worker to get their health and their care?",0.0
False,,"I'll give you the very short answer then Mr. Henley, has much more experience on this. The injured workers are entitled by law to get the treatment that they need and deserved. However, what we have seen in many cases with insolvencies and the kind of litigation that some of the other witnesses testified to is, in some cases, a significant delay in that treatment beginning or continuing or finalizing.",0.0
False,,"And what we like to say is in cases like that, it's a bit of a justice delayed, is justice denied situation.",0.0

False,,"Insolvency delays, meaning that as an earlier witness testified, there is coverage, there's a pool or there's a guarantee. I knew that worker, so the issue is, does an issue of insolvency create a delay?  (And the answer, Senator, is yes.) In their ability to be paid for the care, or the inability to get care? (In the ability to get paid for the care.)",0.0
False,,"Okay, so they could get care, and so, now, in the event of an insolvency, you have some case examples of where there's been delay in being paid for it.",0.0
False,,"Fair enough, now, and that's a big world out there. (If I may, Senator.) Our cases. So, I want to, now, do a follow up question. So, you're saying in the case of insolvencies, there's been a delay in being paid, not in care. May ask the question now. So, obviously, this bill is an attempt to narrow the field in which it would be applicable. Do you know of any cases that would apply to this class of companies that would be benefit from this bill, where you have a situation of insolvencies at that level?",0.0
False,,Where was that company based?,0.0

False,,[INAUDIBLE] what year did that occur?,0.0
False,,"So you're saying that that company, in that State of Illinois, did not have their policy reviewed. And that they became insolvent and that a worker who was injured had a delay in their ability to be repaid or paid for the care that they received.",0.0
False,,"Senator Glazer, if I might on that note Mr. Henly and I double checked after one of these assertions that were made a few moments ago. And according to the WCIRB, about 30% of the policies that were seen in California are large deductible policies, so, the notion that this is a tiny sliver of the marketplace is not borne out by the facts. Now, one can talk about where is the line and what is considered a large deductible, is it 100,000, is it 200,000, 250?",0.0

False,,"Mr Chairman, you're absolutely right. Just a little bit of context, in total fairness to the author and the sponsor. When we had our one and only stakeholder meeting on this issue in April, we raised the issue of some of these insolvencies that had occurred, Lilyco, Lumbermans, Park Avenue I think it's called, and a few others. And we indicated that we were very concerned about the potential risk for harm.",0.0

False,,"We have seen, and again noting that we don't think that we're seeing nearly all of the ancillary agreements that were supposed to legally seen, and that's not a new thing pursuant to the reg taking effect, that predates that, but we have seen ancillary agreements that impact a whole host of a range of issues.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Rocksfield spoke to this a little bit, including cancellation provisions, which obviously fundamentally changes payments and extension, one way extension provisions, that at the insurers interest, they can choose to extend the policy or cancel it at a term that is Shorter than to say three year agreement that an employer may have signed.",0.0

In that, I want to be sure that while we have this dispute about what should have the oversight of the Department of Insurance or not, that I didn't want there to be confusion, certainly unless it was my confusion, which is that somehow out of all of this, we've lost our eye on the ball, which is that we want to be sure that workers who are injured are taken care of promptly and appropriately.",0.0
False,,"So I did have some confusion in going through your answers. But it seemed to be more to me, to be honest, trying to find a defense for your overall philosophical point, rather than the heart of the matter, which i was trying to get to, which is that while we're arguing about where the department should have oversight or not, this isn't about making sure that workers are taken care of.",0.0
False,,"I think I want to caution you that if you have to case to make there, then make the case. But I don't want to misinterpret it, and I don't think we should try to stretch, to deal with a philosophical view as it relates to whether workers are being taken care of, irrespective of this legislation, okay?",0.0
False,,"This isn't about workers out of a job, okay? I don't want to confuse the issue. The issue is workers being able to get the care that they need, right? So, again, I don't like the fog.

False,,"Then defer, but if you want to make the case that this legislation is going to lead to injured workers not being taken care of, then be clear about that.",0.0

False,,"Yes, Senator. And per the mock up, again, I think you're quoting from the bill in print, which is not what's going to be voted on today, because there's a mock up that I believe the author agreed to the amendments pursuant to that.

False,,"It's three or four. So and we do, in fairness, we do appreciate that the movement to a certain extent on that. However, we do feel like it's still, A, confusing, because this is a funky way to get there. And B, we think there is a number of other types of businesses and employers.",0.0

That makes perfect sense.",0.0

Some of the gaps in the Pilot Project and what the expectation was when the Pilot Project was initiated and what the hope was for the study.",0.0
False,,"I can tell you this, a few things; one, the bill was premature. We just read the DMV report that was issued I believe last week and there are still a number of gaps in the implementation of this. A few things to keep in mind, number one, we have a problem in the pilot counties. Less than 50% of individuals who are supposed to install IADs did not. So that is a major problem that needs to be reviewed and understand why there is this lack of compliance. It's something that we've raised back in whatever year it was when the pilot was adopted. That taking this kind of one-size-fits-all approach and removing discretion from judges was going to result in significant gaps. That Really undermine the objectives of the bill. Having judges possess full discretion to identify which individuals need IIDs or additional remedies or additional sanctions on a case by case basis is the best way to go.",0.0
False,,"50% of DUIs in California are Latino drivers. Right, somewhere between 46, 48 every year. There are unique circumstances to each individual. Some, the way other states have looked at this, is that when someone has a high BAC, then it's more likely that you need to require the interlock device. There's greater compliance, there's greater protections. This does not take that approach. We think there is a way to integrate IID into remedies we believe at case by case basis the best way to go. We think we need to look at the results of the study that was just released, we need to evaluate those, we need to come up with a comprehensive approach that we're actually looking into who are these drivers that one, are not complying with the current law and two, how do we actually stem it, let me just close by saying less than 5% of individuals who are arrested for the first time DUI will re-offend within the first year.",0.0

False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just briefly, let me state this just on a personal point. I completely understand the goals. All of our lives have been touched by DUIs in a number of ways. My family's been victims of a DUI driver. We get it, nobody wants that to happen. I've also represented folks who've committed DUIs, so I've kind of seen both sides. That being said on the questions of compliance, a couple of things to keep in mind. One is that the sliding scale that's in the bill, and we've put this in our letters for a possible amendment, the current statute needs to be clarified that all costs. That a business charges to an individual driver need to be subject to the sliding scale. I think that was the intent of the bill when it was adopted a few years back.",0.0
False,,"But what we have found is that the installation companies haven't necessarily done yet. They've limited the sliding scale to certain charges been answered and are ongoing. I think the Senator's been trying to address that. So we do appreciate that. That needs to be stronger two. I'm glad the proponents mentioned the DMV process and I have to remind you, if you're going to do this, part of the compliance issue is that we have a two track system and if you've never had a DUI, and hopefully you've never have, but if you know anyone, folks are shocked that there is a two pardon the pun, but there are two lane process on this. You go to court to deal with your DUI, but then you also to deal with DMV. Occasionally, they over lap for the most part.",0.0
False,,"Folks in the situation are trying to coordinate timing between the DMV and administrative action and the court, so that's where there's huge drop in compliance, because you may address one but not the other, or the timing may be off. I get calls all the time from attorneys that say, I got another guy who's trying to comply, but DMV went forward with a suspension and that's not going to count for the court. The court wants this timing and it's a disaster. So, if you are going to do something state wide what you need to do is frankly maybe get rid of the DMV process or limit it or somehow make it where the two processes work together, because right now it's a nightmare and that's part of the reason why you have such low compliance. The other thing, you have DMV hearings where the DMV officer is the prosecutor and the hearing officer. So, it...",0.0

False,,"Thank you. Mr. Chair, members, Shane Levine on behalf of the California Retailers Association. We must respectfully oppose this bill, because it discriminates against responsible retailers by eliminating the sale of tobacco at essentially all grocery, general merchandise, chain drug, convenience stores, and gas stations. According to this Committee's own analysis, close to 30,000 retailers will no longer be able to sell this product. What that really means is not just about the lack of sales any longer, but the viability and success of a lot of the small business owners in this state and that are here today and their ability to keep their doors open. What this bill will do conversely is shift sales of tobacco products to tobacco only stores.",0.0
False,,"Again, according to this Committee's zone analysis, to meet the new demand, we are anticipating 7,000 tobacco only stores to come online and that's just to start. This is problematic because according to the California Department of Public Health, in 2014 alone 18.4% of tobacco only stores sold to minors, while less than 7.5% of all over stores met the same criteria. Members we just passed this year alone a new age to purchase tobacco to 21, one of only two states that I'm aware of in the country to do that. Revenue from tobacco sales and products has dropped at all of our stores.  That being said, it's still a product we would like to sell responsibly to our adult customers.

False,,"Good afternoon, Members of the Committee. I'm Jennifer Alley with the California Association Health Plan representing 48 public and private organizations that collectively provide healthcare coverage to more than 25 million Californians. CAP and its members are opposed to SB1034.",0.0
False,,CAP member currently provide medical and applied behavior analysis services to their enrollees with autism. SB 946 of Steinburg shifted certain autism services out of the Regional Centers and required health plans to cover those services instead.,0.0
False,,"Since then, autism care has become an essential health benefit. Our members have built an extensive infrastructure network to comply with requirements of SB 946. Because this is part of a health plan fabric, we are not opposed to extending or lifting the current sunset of SB 946.",0.0
False,,"However, we are opposed to SB 1034 because of how this bill expands existing autism coverage in a manner that will increase costs on the private market and require coverage that contradicts medical literature and recommendations.",0.0
False,,"Unlike other mandates before this Committee, the premium impact on this bill is unknown. The expansions are so significant and outside normal benefit perimeters that they were unquantifiable by [UNKNOWN]. This bill would require health plans to cover services at any time or location.",0.0
False,,"Currently health plans allow contracted providers to set their own hours of care, which is provided in a clinically appropriate setting. How a broad and vagueness of any time or location standard will influence provider contracts in the cost of cost and accessibility is unknown.",0.0
False,,What does time and location even mean? We interpret the any time or location standard as forcing health plans into schools among possibly other undefined places. This would be the first time that health plans would be statutorily required to cover services in schools.,0.0
False,,"It is unclear whether schools would want us there in the first place. Any health services received in schools are currently a special education benefit. Under this bill, the health care premium dollar will be used to supplement or replace special education, which will increase premiums.",0.0
False,,We are also concerned that this bill may restrict a provider's ability to actively engage parents in participating in their child's care. Studies have shown that success in treating autism is dependent upon parents or guardians reinforcing behaviors Learned in ABA treatment.,0.0
False,,"While our members understand the time consuming nature of ABA treatment and are sympathetic to the commitments of working parents, we cannot remove parent participation as a part of the treatment plan. Otherwise the behavior modifications will not be successful.",0.0
False,,"In short, we oppose this bill because it is very expansive and vague. Most of these costs are unquantifiable due the vagueness of the requirements, and we believe it will be considerably expensive. A demonstration of how expensive this bill will be that the public sector, MediCal, is being excluded from the bill to avoid cost in appropriations, thus leaving the cost solely on private purchasers of healthcare coverage. For these reasons, we cannot support the expansion of autism services at this time and we are opposed to SB 1034.",0.0
False,,"Currently health plans are not required to go into school settings to provide any health treatments for example, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and what not that's part of the free and appropriate Federal education.",0.0
False,,My members report to me that they will go into a school setting to provide observational care to see what behavior is going on with the child. But that the treatment for that would take place outside of school.,0.0
False,,"We're looking at 48 different health plans in 1,000 different school districts that have the ability to determine who can and can't come on their campus. And so part of out concerns with pushing us into there is what happens to the health plan if we're required to provide something and the school says no, what is liability for that coverage.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and Members, Ran Martin, on behalf of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. You all know AHF is the leading provider across the globe in terms of care and treatment of people with HIV but, we're also a major player in the STD world since STD's are often a precursor to HIV.",0.0
False,,"We think they need to do more things, unfortunately the Legislature signed yesterday by the Governor included an additional $5 million, that was more than double what they had in their budget as of last year.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We would like to thank the author and the sponsor for the meaningful dialogue that we have had over SB 908, and while the amendments are being taken today improve the bill in certain key areas, we are unfortunately unable to remove our opposition at this time.",0.0
False,,"The health plans are not opposed to providing more information to consumers if it is meaningful, it can be implemented, and does not lead to market disruption at a time when our marketplace is still evolving. To that end, we did supply the author and the Committee with amendments that reflect our position that the notice in this bill should dovetail or run concurrently with the existing rate renewal notice if the regulators make an unreasonable determination before the open enrollment period.",0.0
False,,"In this way, the consumer can be noticed at the same time he or she receives the rate change letter at the annual open enrollment period. At that time, the consumer would be able to evaluate all of the information together and make an informed decision whether to stay with their plan or switch to a new one. We think that a one off letter might confuse someone into thinking that they must switch away from a plan that is currently meeting their needs.",0.0
False,,"While the language being offered today does include new timelines intended to help the situation, it still would require plans to send a one-off notice and comply with special enrollment requests if the regulator did not meet the timeline in the amendments. We do not believe that the requirements in the bill should activate if the determination by the regulator is made in the middle of open enrollment or after the new policy year is started which, in that case, would be particularly disruptive.",0.0
False,,"So, from a fundamental perspective, our issue is predictability. Predictability helps health plans develop the most accurate rates. Allowing people through the special enrollment option in this bill to come in and out of the market outside of existing enrollment periods makes it harder to price products accurately. So we have concerns around potential disruption there. We are happy to sit down with the author and sponsor again to continue the dialogue over this bill if it moves today. But we are opposed unless amended at this time. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"No, thank you, Assembly Member. And as the sponsor noted, there are times when the unreasonable determination does happen after open enrollment begins, and after the policy year starts. I think it's debatable whether it's due to a lack of responsiveness by one side or the other. I'm not disagreeing, necessarily, but I just don't know.",0.0
False,,"But in any case, the amendments that we put forward stated that if the regulator makes a timely determination, that we would include it in our notice. The amendments, I think, attempt to address that issue. The author amendments attempt to address that issue. That still leaves open the question that even if the health plan does comply with requests for information, and the regulators do not make the 60 day or meet the 60 day window, that the provisions of this bill, including what I would call the deterrents provisions of this bill, which is a special enrollment period, would activate.",0.0
False,,"And so, if everything was going according to timeline and going to plan, there would be no need for that deterrents provision in terms of the new special enrollment option, which we believe should be removed from the bill otherwise.",0.0

False,,"Many of these vehicles that we're talking about are both a vehicle used on the farm, but also a personal vehicle. So while you may be out checking irrigation water, hauling a few cows, it's probably the same vehicle you're also going to use to take your family to church on Sunday, and go to the grocery store. So it's not uncommon for vehicles used in agriculture to be treated differently.",0.0
False,,"And given the fact that these same vehicles are both being used for a farm and a personal use, we do think certainly the bill is necessary. Relative to the exemption itself, the exemption is extremely narrow, it's specific to a gross combined weight rating of 26,000 pounds, between the tow vehicle and",0.0
False,,"the trailer that any point in time you exceed that, the exemption does not apply. It also is only based for people who are operating in a not-for-hire capacity, which means if you are physically being paid or compensated to haul, whether it's livestock or another product the exemption does not apply. Last and not least, the exemption is definitely enforceable.",0.0
False,,"The exemption is based on current language, and the commercial drivers license, portion of the vehicle code and all of the things in it, in terms of the criteria have been vetted since 1988 when it was passed into law.

The studies in general, across the country, show two consistent results, cost savings to Medicaid are significant and well above the costs of the program.",0.0
False,,"And these studies, these results come from housing and services, not just services. In fact, they show that providing intensive services alone to people who remain homeless do not result in any cost savings. In fact, costs, Medi-Cal systems and Medicaid systems in general go up.

I think we're all frustrated when, just as consumers, we can't reach people that are important to us in doing our business. And let alone having that happen to law enforcement.

False,,Can I ask a quick question?,0.0
False,,"I had a question to Mr. Salzillo and also to Mr. Ewart, if he could come back up. Mr. Salzillo, I'm struggling with this because you've argued that it's a burden, right, to have this requirement. Isn't it possible that you could have as a, just as a submittal on any kind of police report that involves video, an acknowledgement that this may be released by the department, and therefore three days notice is hereby given that that's a possibility. Right from the beginning, just from the submittal of a police report that includes video, isn't that something that procedurally could be done?",0.0
False,,"But the three day wait could occur in the midst of a PR8, right? I mean it could happen during that 10 day period, but what I'm saying is, why couldn't it just be as a regular course of business that if you are submitting a report that includes any kind of video, which I assume would be a common occurrence, that it would be part of the disclaimer, the waiver in some ways that they've received a notice that three days starting now, would run, and doesn't mean that anything's going to be released, but at least you've given the notice that's required by this bill.",0.0
False,,"Yes, sir.",0.0
False,,"Got it. Okay. And then to Mr. Ewart, if I may, Madam Chair?",0.0
False,,"Because they could, whether 3 days notice is given or not, the officers in those cases could have, and in fact they did, they didn't get 3 days notice. They took whatever action under existing law, to challenge the release and that procedure took months and years. But how would this bill affect those examples in any way?",0.0
False,,"Madam Chair, I have a follow up question.",0.0
False,,"I'm not sure that I heard a direct answer to how this legislation would affect that except that it is a new practice the body cameras are new, this video accessibility is a newer issue. I'm not sure I heard clearly that this is somehow going to create this enormous proliferation of officers going to court to prevent it. But, the other issue that you raised is that, and you said this is going to be a stranglehold over information, stranglehold.",0.0
False,,"And I'm, again, struggling to see how three days of potential delay, and I think that if the police station actually incorporated the fact that there may be video released right from the beginning, that there really would be no delay, that somehow that's going to procreate a stranglehold over information. So, struggling to see, I'm sympathetic to disclosure, don't get me wrong, but I'm struggling to see how the world is going to crash, because this bill would be put into effect.",0.0
False,,"Good morning, Madame Chair, members. Caliph Assagai on behalf of the California Public Defenders Association, in respectful opposition to this measure. While we understand the need to address human trafficking and to address the behavior of those directing human trafficking.

False,,"We have, CCSA has put forward a number of proposals to fix that problem.

False,,We need to make sure that there are not any for-profit charter schools operating in the State of California. We currently only find six among the 1230 that currently exist. But even six is too many. We would like to put a wall up around California so that no for-profits come into California. And the way to do that is to simply say that every charter school in California must be a non-profit. Period.,0.0
False,,The second piece of this is creating a firewall between the nonprofit charter school and any for-profit vendor in which it contracts. So that there is not a De facto control of that nonprofit charter school by the for profit entity. There are lots of good reasons why for profit should play a legitimate and substantive role.,0.0
False,,"It happens in school districts. It happens in charter schools and that should be allowed to continue, but we should not have a for profit operating in reality or a sense of De facto a charter school. We hope that if this bill doesn't move forward that the author will take seriously the amendments we have proposed.",0.0
False,,"We do think that they are amendments that could possibly get a better reception. In the governor's office than this more sweeping approach in AB 1084. And we urge you not to move the bill, but if it is going to move, we need to consider these kinds of events, thank you.",0.0

Student turnover is very excessive at those schools, there was a larger port done last year by Stanford Credo that didn't focus specifically on for profit, they focused more broadly on virtual charter schools but had some very disturbing data.",0.0
False,,"I think some of the headlines in the Washington Post said things like it's as if kids did not attend school the entire year.

And they're typically created at the request of local agencies and interest groups, and stake holders, because one size doesn't necessarily fit all in California, and this particular basin, substantial acreage is covered by mutual water companies, and in order to get the coverage under sigma, to cover the entire part of the sub basin this governance model was decided as the best way for the locals to be able to implement Sigma. So I'd be pleased to answer any questions the Committee may have.",0.0

False,,"That's correct assemblymember Gordon. Under the government code 6500 fset, joint powers agencies may include a mutual water company for example. But the sustainable groundwater management act put in a different definition for a joint powers authority and it limits it to local agencies only.

I'll begin by just simply saying that as home builders, and you all recognized the need, I hope, for housing in California. I don't hear the motivation for this bill as being something that targets new housing. We bring new housing in the communities that need new housing at their clean projects, we are subject to some of the strictest rules in the country both from the federal state, regional, and local levels. They cover all aspects and every conceivable environmental impact that you could think of whether or not it's even something as minor as noise and light that affects neighboring properties. We also have Sequoia in case anything slips through the cracks, we have a very robust, private right of action in Sequoia to ensure that our projects are the cleanest in the country.",0.0
False,,"And that we are providing housing and well paying jobs for those communities that we work in, and so what we're concerned with. Primarily with this bill is the fact that when you put something in a general plan, our projects have to be consistent with that general plan, and there's no way of getting around that. What we don't want to do is unnecessarily drive up the cost of new housing that are needed in these communities to mitigate impacts,that they have no causal nexus to and this is our fundamental concern, so what we're looking for is some language in the bill that indicates an intent not to do that.",0.0
False,,"It is a prohibition required by the constitution that we want some recognition in this bill of simply to have the practitioners who are going be looking through it and trying to implement it, be aware of it.

False,,"Mr. Chairman and members, my name is Jeffrey Berman.",0.0
False,,"My name is Jeffrey Burman. I'm a lawyer. I represent a number of the California's religious colleges and universities. The reason, or one of the reasons, that we oppose the bill, and we only had a short time to review it, and less time to review the analysis, is that the religious schools are being singled out for special treatment, in this case it's not specially good treatment, it's especially bad treatment. For example, they are the only ones being required to give a Title 9 disclosure whereas other schools may have other exemptions from other statutes from state or federal, and the are not being required to disclose that they are giving, taking those exemptions. When we read the bill last night, and the analysis, it's not clear to us as to whether this is limited to students only.",0.0
False,,"We think it is, we think it's the author's intent, and AICCU has been told that it's the author's intent that this is a student bill, and the Committee analysis says the same thing, but there is a possibility by tucking this into 1135 that somebody could argue that it is also an employment bill, which it's not, and that needs to be clarified and we're working with Senator De Lara's staff to try and clarify that. There's also language exempting, there's no language exempting the schools from the prohibition against religious discrimination, which, for example, would allow them to choose coreligionists or to enforce their religious base rules.",0.0
False,,"Those were in prior versions of the bill, but they're not in the current version of the bill, and they need to be there, otherwise you couldn't, for example, have Catholic schools say they were taking Catholic students only, or giving preference to Catholic students. With regard to housing, restrooms and married student housing, again, the religious schools are being singled out on the violation of Federal law. They are the only schools that are going to have special rules in the government code that relate to these very issues. The impact on athletics is not clear. You can't tell from 11135 whether that's also going to regulate what happens in the locker room and on the field and admission to teams.",0.0
False,,"I know that some of the schools right now are working with the NC 2A on these types of issues, trying to make sure that they don't become issues, and we don't come back here again, but the direct stakeholders need to be involved in this, and it shouldn't be swept in by mistake under 11135. There's also a CalGrants issue. Everybody has understood that this bill is not intended to impact the ability of students who get CalGrants to chose the schools that they want to go to and there was prior language carving out Cal grants and making sure it's safe and we're going to be working again with the Senator's staff to try and make sure that that's taken care of.",0.0
False,,"Because I don't think anybody wants to tell the student that you can't go to this school. You can't use the money that we're giving you to go to the school of your choice. When you look at the federal case law on this, you can only do these kinds, take these kinds of actions with respect to religious institutions if there's a compelling state interest and here, it's really anecdotal. We've got six schools or less that have taken the Title IX exemption, and some of those exemptions are decades old and have nothing to do with LGBT students at all. We've got a single letter directed to one of the schools relating to immigration, which the analysis says it was a mistake and that the letter was withdrawn.",0.0
False,,"Tom, I'll show you that later on and then, there's also some unproved allegations like the one we heard today, so it's trial by allegation. Okay, the lead targeting case, which is not addressed in the analysis, is the Lukumi Babalu case, which says that you cannot target students and we also don't think the Smith or the Bob Jones cases add anything, because there was no targeting in those cases and they need to be harmonized with the Hosanna-Tabor decision and all religious institutions to determine who their members are, in this case the students, and to shape their own faith and mission.",0.0

False,,"That's the state policy, we've got to do everything we can to get there. Storage is an important part of that.

It's around this concept, among others, that we have issued a letter of concerns about this particular bill and if the bill moves today, our industry wants to remain a key part of the discussion so that our issues can be properly addressed.

False,,"we do believe that some changes could be made to the bill to improve the workability of the bill, hold down out of network costs to enrollees as much as possible, and to encourage, not discourage, contracting between plans and providers. Because when plans and providers do contract, consumer protections",0.0
False,,"are inherently in place that ban balanced billing and other practices. As currently drafted, we do view some of the provisions of the bill as unworkable and will unintentionally increase costs and establish a payment structure.

My message today is simple. Israeli Americans like any immigrant community have the right to connect to their heritage and conduct a business with their home country, Israel, free from harassment and discrimination. Proponents of the BDS movement claim that they are part of a peaceful movement which is non-violent and even supported by Jews who have lived in Israel. So it couldn't possibly be anti-semitic.

False,,"Unfortunately, during the economic downturn, we saw kind of the public perception change.

False,,"So in other words, how frequently do students transfer relative to their share of their home communities? Our data did show that White and Asian students tended to transfer at relatively high rates. Hispanic and Latino students tended to transfer at somewhat lower rates.",0.0
False,,"We're not exactly sure why that is, it could be different levels of interest in the program. It could be different levels of awareness of the option, different abilities to get to a different district. But stepping back from that for a minute, we found that the program is about 10,000 participating students.",0.0
False,,"About 3,600 of them are White, about 3,300 are Hispanic Latino, about 2,400 are Asian. So I think it's was encouraging us to, encouraging for us to see that all three of California's largest ethnic groups are represented among program participants.",0.0
False,,"And we think that's a sign that the program appeals to students from a variety of backgrounds across the state. In terms of the other part of your question, it might help to get a little comparative perspective that most transfers take place through the inter-district transfer permit system.",0.0
False,,"And through that system a district can really reject an applicant for any reason. Common reasons might be the student isn't doing well in school, they have poor attendance, or even the district thinks they're going to be more costly to educate than other students.",0.0
False,,The District of Choice program is different than that in that a district that opts in has to agree to accept all students up to its locally approved limit. And conduct a lottery of it's oversubscribed. We asked districts of choice to describe how they administer students.,0.0

False,,"As really checked on that, we also looked at those districts board's policies and application materials. They also seem to be consistent with the statutory requirements, so hopefully that gives you some context about our findings.",0.0
False,,"I think that's a very timely question. By way of context, we found that most districts of choice, including most of the large ones, generally don't provide transportation, either to students within their district or students who are transferring in.",0.0
False,,Some of the smaller more ruled districts did provide transportation. I believe we only found two that were actually sending a bus or a van or a vehicle into a neighboring district. Statewide transportation isn't provided all that widely.,0.0
False,,"Only about 1-in-12 students statewide receives transportation, so it's actually relatively uncommon for a district to provide it to any kind of student.

False,,"probably front-loaded in terms of the infrastructure that's going to be needed for the PSAPs to be able to accept the data that wireless phones can already deliver, we have to remember that 911 fees are not just imposed in a vacuum.

False,,"Good morning. Ryan Andersen, Legislative Analyst Office. The sergeant has passed out a handout that I'll be covering this morning just giving some really 30,000 foot view of charter schools in California, their history, and there's the oversight responsibilities that they're subject to. Turning to the first page, this is just a brief introduction of what our charter schools, state first established charter schools in 1992 as the second state to do so after only Minnesota and at that time the intent was really to experiment with a new trade-off between on the one hand autonomy, and on the other, accountability.",0.0
False,,"So charter schools are public schools that are allowed substantial autonomy from state education regulations. They are not subject to most of the state education code and in return for that, they are subject to a unique accountability system that requires them to respond mostly to the demands of their authorizers and I'll get into that more later. All charter school must meet some basic requirements that are spelled out on this first page, but as you can see these are very basic requirements. They must provide non sectarian instruction, be tuition free and in the middle interested California students up to school capacity. The second page really highlights one notable aspect.",0.0
False,,"There's charter schools in California which is that they've been growing quite significantly since they were first established just in the last 10 years. Both the number of charter schools and the number of students served by charter schools has more than doubled in the state. The proportion of K-12 enrollment that has served in charter schools has increased from about 3% in 2005, 6 to just over 9% last year. Another typical aspect of charter schools, is that they tend to be smaller than traditional public schools. Many of them are, in fact, the median charter school has an enrollment that's a little less than half of the median, non charter public school and also, they tend to be concentrated in urban areas so just the nine counties that make up the Bay Area as well as Los Angeles and San Diego counties.",0.0
False,,"Just those 11 counties count for over 60% of all charter schools in the state. Turning to page three, there are several varieties of charter schools. In particular, some charter schools, about 85% of those currently operating, are what we call start ups. These are new schools that were established specifically to operate as charter schools. A smaller share of charter schools, about 15% currently, what we call convergence, they started their life as traditional public schools but if since being converted to operate under a charter. Another important division is that most charter schools about 80% currently focused on traditional classroom based instruction, but the minority about 20% offer some form of independent study.",0.0
False,,"This might be distance learning, or home study. On page four, we have a brief overview of how charter schools are authorized. When charter schools are established through a local petition process. Specifically, charter schools must receive signatures from either 50% of the teachers that they expect to employ in their first year of operation or 50% of the parents they intend to serve in that first year. Now, once these petitions have received enough signatures they are submitted to a perspective authorizer in most cases that will be the district where the school intends to locate. The authorizer has to make a decision whether to approve or deny the petition and they can do this for five specific reasons.",0.0
False,,"Some of these reasons are technical in nature. For instance, simply the petitioners did not receive enough valid signatures or the proposed school does not meet basic state requirements for all charter schools, but we believe in many cases when charter petitions are denied, it's related to the belief on the perspective authorizes part that the charter petition and one thing to note here is the petition itself lays out a comprehensive vision for the school. The authorizer will often reject the petition if they believe that that vision represents an unsound educational program or, if they believe the petitioners are unlikely to realize the educational program.",0.0
False,,"Now, if a petition is denied by a local district, the petitioners can appeal that decision to either their county Superintendent or to the State Board of Education. In some instances specific charter schools can apply directly to their county Superintendent or to the State Board to service their authorizer. I'm turning to page five. This is just a discussion of specifically the role of charter school oversight. Most ongoing oversight of charter schools is the responsibility of the authorizer and state law does spell out some basic conditions that all authorizers must meet. Maintaining regular contact and visits with the charter school.",0.0
False,,"Ensuring that the charter school is completing all of its state reporting requirements. Monitoring the charter school's finances. For the services, charter school authorizes typically charge a fee of up to 1% of the total revenue that comes into the charter school. Now, once every five years or so, authorizers must make a decision as to whether the charter will be renewed or not. This renewal process is very similar to the petition process, which is to say that the authorizer can decide to revoke a charter for the same reasons that it might deny an initial petition. One wrinkle to that is that state law does specify some very basic minimum academic performance requirements that charters school must meet to be renewed.",0.0
False,,"However, these minimum performance requirements are based off of the state's old accountability system. This is the academic performance index, or API, which has been suspended because these reference an outdated accountability system there is some ambiguity currently as to what these requirements really mean when authorizers are making their renewal decision. Our final page is just a table that shows some of the major legislative changes that have been made regarding charter school oversight since the Charter School Act was passed in 1992. I'm not going to go through all of them, but the big takeaway here is that the legislators has periodically reviewed these oversight requirements and made adjustments to them.",0.0
False,,"In particular, the Legislature has strengthened the fiscal oversight of charter schools since their enactment. Requiring more reporting from the charters to their authorizers on an annual and even semi-annual basis and also, most recently, when the state overhauled its K12 financial and accountability systems, charter schools were included in that and they are required to submit annual local control and accountability plans, or, LCAPs. They're very similar to those that are required of all districts. Many charter schools and authorizers believe that this was a significant change to how charter schools are operated. That's it's for my initial remarks, but if you have any questions my colleague and I would be happy to answer them.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Senator Huff. It's a question that the state has had in the past. I think it gets a little bit tricky to get to answer because many schools, including the school districts, will rely on some for-profit entity to at least to some extent. For example, a school district might buy a textbook from a for-profit company just as a charter school would, but there's also greater levels of control that might be present in a charter school, too. A for-profit company could be more involved, say, in hiring teachers, in coordinating instruction. The latest data that the state has shows that the number of charter schools that are, sort of, legally, themselves, a for-profit entity, is quite small, perhaps only a handful throughout the state.",0.0
False,,"But that doesn't include charter schools that might rely on a for-profit company to provide some of their curriculum. So really, rather than being for-profit or non-profit, we think of it more like a continuum as far as how involved a company like that would be.  You have no data that separates out performance on a for-profit versus not-for-profit?",0.0
False,,"I don't believe we have any statewide data on renewal rates. Certainly, there are some charter schools over the years that haven't been renewed, but as far as the reasons for that, unfortunately, we don't have a great sense.",0.0
False,,"Sure, so the authorizer is the main reviewer of any of these reports. There are a few reports that do end up with the state. For example, charter schools undergo an audit and that audit ends up being reported to the S Controller's office and the Department of Education. There will be some follow up if the auditors note a finding, but In general, most of the reporting, like the local control and accountability plans, and the budget updates, those are being reviewed directly by the authorizer. The state doesn't have a big role in that kind of oversight.",0.0
False,,"Beyond the reports that go directly to the state, that Ken just indicated, charter schools similar, as you suggested, to many districts rely on really specific interventions, when problems are suspected. So authorizers can request that the fiscal crisis management and assistance team, or FCMAT, come in to perform an audit when they suspect that there's a problem that's similar to the process that we go through for district's fiscal side.",0.0
False,,"It's a timely question and I think you hinted at the answer earlier. It does seem to vary around the state. The charter school law sets up this plan, actually this part of that, a change Legislature created in the early 2000s, where charter schools are expected to apply directly to the school district where they're located and the statute includes a few exceptions, I think that's been a real point of contention the past few years, about whether some of these geographic exceptions are being used appropriately and I think that's something you're likely to hear a lot more about on the some of the subsequent panels.",0.0
False,,"So the API for many years was the main way that the state sort of looked at charter school academic accountability. Moving forward, there are going to be these evaluation rubrics that the state is adopting that might take a little bit broader look, but at this point it's a real challenge. The state doesn't have a real strong system of looking at charter schools and comparing them, right now, just given the limitations with our new accountability system.",0.0
False,,"I think for the past few years, it's been about maybe 70 to 80 new charter schools per year, so a little bit less than 100. I think there were a handful of a few years where it was above that, but the state, as you know, has a rolling cap on the number of charter schools that is currently up to around 1800 so with 1200 active charter schools, the state has been well below its cap for a number of years.",0.0

What have we been co-sponsoring, what kind of specific proposals around charter school oversight have we been working on?",0.0
False,,"There was a lot of mention today about, well I know that Senator Monning brought up what happens with expulsion of students in charter schools, and there is currently a vehicle, Senate Bill 322 by Senator Leno, which establishes what level of due process should all students at charter schools get when they're being expelled,",0.0
False,,"so that's one of the proposals that we're co-sponsoring. Additionally, we're co-sponsoring a piece about requiring districts to look internally at whether they have the capacity to do charter school oversight.

Also a proposal about requiring districts to do educational and fiscal impact analysis of their entire school community before approving new charter schools and firm in the public interest mention the example of what a fiscal impact report might look like with respect to Los Angeles Unified.,0.0
False,,"Two more proposals, strengthening conflict of interest laws in the face of a recent report by the Center for Popular Democracy that identifies $81 million of fraud, waste, and abuse of tax dollars in the charter school environment in California alone. And then also ensuring that charter school governance is transparent, accountable to the communities they serve, and accessible to the public.",0.0
False,,"I've said this In Committee before, but I think it's relevant to this conversation that the establishment of charter schools was not us, the public yielding control to the agencies that serve us. We did not intend charter schools to do whatever they want with the tax dollars they receive. To the contrary, we insist on staying informed and on retaining control.",0.0
False,,"There is an audit currently approved by the Joint Legislative Audit Committee to look at tax dollars, specifically at alliance public schools to make sure that those dollars are being appropriately spent on children, and not on other uses. But aside from thanking you for your focus today, I also want to give a special shout-out to Senator Mendoza who's carrying three out of those five proposals moving forward.",0.0

False,,"Madame Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association Advocacy, and I'm sure you know I wouldn't miss this chance to testify before you one more time. Last word. So I just want to put a button on a handful of issues that have come up, some in questions from Senators, some that have come up in some of the testimony. One of the other early questions this morning was how many for profits and how many nonprofits. We actually do know that number. There are 6 for profits in the State of California out of the 1,238 charter schools. Most of the bulk of those are actually what we refer to as autonomous or independent charter schools that are nonprofits that are organically created in the community.",0.0
False,,"Some of them are also charter schools that are run by the school district or the County Office of Education and a handful of those are also nonprofits, but there are also district schools. So we're talking about 6 for profits, but it is an issue that CCSA Cares very much about. We're working with Ms. Bonilla as a speak on bill that would deal with that and we hope that we're going to, excuse me, find resolution on that issue before the Legislator adjourns this year. We are very committed to the whole concept of innovation and charter schools being laboratories of innovation. It's a two sided coin though, there are efforts by some charter schools to disseminate that information and to share best practices, but we also need school districts that are receptive to that information.",0.0
False,,"And we need to find a better way to meet both sides of that coin as we go forward and in fact, we've been texting during this hearing among ourselves and want to look at that issue a little bit more during the fall and see if there are some other things that we can suggest to this Committee in the future. On the issue of transparency and conflict of interest, there is a bill pending as Mr. Bramble indicated. We support Public Records Act applying to charter schools, we support the Brown Act applying to charter schools. We support the Political Reform Act applying to charter schools.",0.0
False,,"We think that if a bill moves forward with those three things in it, it will pass this Legislature and we can do everything we can to convince the Governor to sign it, and have that issue dealt with once and for all. We encourage all the parties to participate in that and finally, I just want to respond quickly to the ACLU report that was mentioned, fortunately ACLU and Public Advocates came to us before it was released and we have talked about it all the way up to our CEO level and we appreciate some of the findings, we are very concerned about academic exclusions, which only accounted for about 2% of all of the cases that they identified in their report.",0.0
False,,"We do dispute using terms such as interviews and auditions at a performing arts academy as exclusionary. So we don't think that is as big a problem from that standpoint as ACLU does, but we are very committed to working with them and with CDE to make sure that our schools that are definitely violating the law relative to academic exclusion are educated about how they need to deal with that and make some policy changes. So lots of things to do. Senator, we'll miss having you participate in these in the future. I personally will come and ask your opinion even though you're no longer in the Legislature.

False,,"David Munez, Department of Finance. Mr. Chair, Members of the Committee. Every single bargaining unit that the administration has been in negotiations with in the past year or so all has different and unique issues to address. Some of which are recruitment and retention problems, major salary lags, extreme vacancies. Things of that nature and as part of that, specific to bargain unit seven, we identified a few classifications that have extreme recruitment, retention and salary lag issues and as part of this agreement, we've made a modest step for enclosing the gap on some of the salary lapse and addressing some of these recruitment and retention issues.",0.0
False,,"I would just point out that there was a special salary adjustment included in this contract for the ABCD agents, and also there was an additional special salary adjustment for Cal OES coordinators. Both of these particular classifications did have vacancy rates exceeding our statewide average, and also had some significant recruitment and retention issues. So, aside from those, the other provisions of this contract do have some similarities to the other recent MOUs. With that, I'd be happy to answer any questions.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, yes, the classification structure that we have in state government civil services, it's very broad, and we have a lot of similar classifications out there that maybe working for different departments, but maybe doing slightly different work, but there's always an argument to be made that just because of the size and breadth of our classifications, that occasionally we run into nuances where we have certain employees working in departments that are doing very similar work to someone else in another department, yet their pay is substantially different.",0.0
False,,"And what that ends up creating is employees come in, work for one department for a short period of time, get the training they need, and they're immediately out the door to the next classification where they can make more money and what this agreement does is make a strong step forward in preventing that for these ABC agents and Cal OES coordinators. I know some of my colleagues, Senator Hancock included, are familiar with this.",0.0
False,,"Yes, absolutely Senator. So, a couple comments to that. The first, I would mention is that, and as this Committee has likely heard a number of times, our civil service kind of improvement measures that we've been endeavoring. As part of that we're looking at a massive, broad, class consolidation and as part of that we would be looking at investor agent classifications, and these salary differences throughout the state. That's the first piece. With regards to your question with insurance investigators, included in this MOU, we have made a modest step forward with this small special salary adjustment for the investigator classification across the board of roughly 5%.",0.0
False,,"So the issue that you're referring to now, we believe that this MOU will help solve that problem. It may not completely solve that at this point, but we're definitely making a strong step forward to address that.",0.0
False,,"Thank you for the question. So with regards to ABC agents, this special salary adjustment will bring them within 5% of the DOJ agents and that was one of our primary issues is that all of our ABC agents were then going to DOJ. So by bringing them that much closer there isn't as much as an incentive to leave ABC to go to DOJ with regards to the Callaway's coordinators, we are bringing them with imparity of a similar classification that works at CAL FIRE.",0.0
False,,"So Cali Char per statute actually produces a salary survey for every bargaining unit, I believe within six months of the expiration of the contract.",0.0
False,,Exactly.,0.0
False,,"Some of these are sworn peace officers and are subject to a safety retirement, and I believe that in that case they would not subject to Social Security, but I'd like to double check that and I can give that information for you and your staff.",0.0
False,,"Great question, so anytime we're doing collective bargaining, and we're making some adjustments to the pay skills of our rank and file consideration is always given to how that impacts our excluded supervisor, managers and so forth. HR has the authority to make that adjustment, so for example if we do a 5% salary increase for a certain classification, CALHR will take a look at the impact or compaction to the next supervisor or the next direct report and if they make a determination that compaction is an issue, they have the authority to also send that pay raise up through the ranks.",0.0
False,,"Senator Stone, great questions. So couple comments on that is that the retiree benefit, the Op Ed benefit, is something that's highly valued by our ranking file, and actually all of the civil service employees and it's been a great recruitment and retention to all for us and as you have mentioned there are cases in which private sector and maybe some locals out there are paying more, but they're not offering the same total compensation benefit package that the state has and It's something that's important to us, to the administration, and to our employees and our Op Ed strategy that we have put forth will put it on a sustainable path and at some point, when we reach full funding, it will be a much more affordable benefit than it currently is today.",0.0
False,,"The short answer to your question is yes, about 30 years it will take. The key of the strategy is that we are continuing to do our pay as you go for healthcare at this point, but on top of that we continue to reach agreement with our bargaining units. We're actually free funding into a what we're terming a lock box, but a trust fund and for every dollar that the employee and the employer puts in that lockbox, a dollar for dollar reduction occurs to the unfunded liability and in approximately 30 years, we would have completely paid off the unfunded liability from an accounting perspective.",0.0
False,,"And then we can unlock the trust fund and use that plus the investment returns to start paying for our Op Ed cost, very similar to how we pay for our pensions. One other piece to your question is that annually we have a contract actuary that does kind of our evaluations for us and lets us know exactly where we stand in regards to the unfunded liability and this 30 year projection is based on our most recent evaluation.",0.0
False,,"Based on salary alone, I do not have an example for that right now and really, the reason for that is is that the administration looks at total compensation, because as some of the other members have stated here today is that the cost of the benefits we provide are very expensive. The define benefit program, OPAV, and so we like to include all of that into the total compensation package and when we measure that. Against public, private, other localities. It gives us a good apples to apples comparison.",0.0
False,,"There's so many classifications out there, Mr. Chair, that I am sure that there is an example of some classification that may be on a salary to salary comparison is at, or possibly above a market salary for a private sector, but I would say that, that is the exception, not the rule.",0.0
False,,"I'm tracking your question now. So let's just use the typical civil service employee that is pre-pension reform and can retire at 55. So between the age of 55 and 65, the employee is not eligible for Medicare at that point, so they're staying on what we term the basic healthcare plan. It's the same plan that all of our active employees are on. Once they hit 65 years old, statute requires that those employees enroll in basically a Medicare supplement plan and at that point, what happens is the state share of those retiree costs are roughly cut in half. So to your question, yes, Medicare does come in and supplement at that point.",0.0
False,,"Yes, for a lack of a better way to describe it, that's how it works. We have two funding sources providing the same benefit for the employee or for the retired annuitant.",0.0
False,,This is my issue as well.,0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. And my questions are on the issue of ESCO, another new acronym that I hadn't heard of before. How much money's set aside for this program in our budget?",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chairman, members, Richard Marcus for the Western Electrical Contractors Association and Associate Builders and Contractors of California and a few other contractor groups. I disagree with the characterization on the ESCO from the Department of General Services. The language in this bill differ from Senator's Wolk's bill in particular,",0.0
False,,Senator Wolk's bill allow the PLA to only satisfy their monthly reporting requirement in this measure if there's a PLA there is absolutely no requirement to use a skilled trained workforce. The Esco could go to loads or home depot to hire their employees if there is a PLA. The other important distinction is the previous measures had a phase in provision,0.0
False,,"that started out at 20 or 30%, had to be graduates from an apprenticeship program. This bill immediately goes to the 60% graduation requirement. We're suspicious that the escos will have a challenge satisfying that 60% graduation requirement and finally to Senator Moorlach's We",0.0
False,,"do firmly believe that the PLA language is a disincentive for fair an open competition. We think that the best result comes from fair and open competition, letting anyone without the extraneous issues associated with a PLA. And finally, I did appreciate the clarification on the 35 year contract.",0.0
False,,But it would seem that if this program sunsets in four years that the State would not need the authority in the bill to enter into a 35 year contract with Enesco and might obvious gracious suggestion would be that the language should be consistent. And that whatever authority for the ESCO contracts should be consistent with when the program sends that. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Mr Chair, I know this is in the weeds, but one of the witnesses did make the point that with 35 years still being in as the term of the ESCO, yeah, it expires in four years. Whether that would allow the state to enter into a longer term contract and what this bill would allow for the continuation of this- So it's just a point again, small one, but I don't know.",0.0

False,,"That speaks to why you should be more engaged and more specific in terms of what changes. because again, we're left with a choice at this moment in time. And so, you have preferences and you have worries about how this may affect. Well, I'm sorry about that. And now, we are where we are.",0.0

False,,"Can you talk about this confusion and what that, and how serious this might be for that borrower?",0.0

Both sides promised they would provide me that information. Both sides provided me maybe one company that was doing well on each side.,0.0
False,,"Basically we want to clean up the wealthy areas first and then we'll get to you. And then when I had problem with an oil company in my district, where people were getting sick and I ask that oil producer who had a well in backyard to stop polluting and that children were being affected I was told that those were anecdotal stories and I said, I don't think you understand, it is true and it is happening.",0.0

False,,"So again, from both sides, from my perspective in 2015, when I was asked how we would vote on SP32 or SP350, I said I don't know. And I probably was going to lean toward a no vote.

In California, we have had in place for a number of years, a requirement that if you're a juvenile, that the interrogation requires that it be videotaped, but that has been not in place for adults, which is what this measure does.

False,,"Yeah, my name's Mike West with District Council 16, Painters and Allied Trades. And what I'd like to add with Assembly Member Levine and my colleague Robert Williams is that many people don't realize that the work environment in construction in California is at-will employment, so either you're making money for the company, or you're not.",0.0
False,,"And sometimes that can be perceived through pressure from your own coworkers or the schedule or the third party entities. So, in some of these cases, it would entail worker feeling like his job might be on the line in face of a layoff, save the company money by waiting until nobody's looking, lift up the containment and blow all the contaminated slag into the bay, or onto the ground below, an environmental crime.",0.0

False,,"Thank you, Madam President and members. I want to explain at least my thinking about this issue, because it's easy to be misunderstood. The issue of money in our elections is seriously a problem at all levels and I also concur that I think one of the biggest ways to deal with it is in disclosure and rapid disclosure, and we have that at the state level, that contribution is given over $1000. We have 90 days before the general election, we have to report it within 24 hours and so whether you take that contribution or not, you know that it's going to be disclosed. The challenge we have with these campaign finance reform ideas is the work around and that you can say there's a limit, and then look at what happens with the interests that may want to engage in that election.",0.0
False,,"They create these independent expenditure committees and then they campaign in a way that you as a candidate, whether they're supporting you or not, you may not agree with, and there's very little accountability for that. So it's a challenging area to try to get your hands around when you realize we need to find ways to do these things better. I don't agree with my colleague from Santa Monica when he suggests that this is a true local control measure, because our local cities and counties, they have the ability to set limits today at any level without this piece of legislation.",0.0
False,,"If you're unhappy with how your city is handling this issue, well then, go and petition your government and encourage them to establish limits as you think are appropriate, but this answer from the state that we're going to tell everybody they have to take the issue up, to me, is not necessarily a healthy way of trying to deal with the problems that we see it. We may see later today, a bill on this floor that deals with the funneling of money from one Committee to another, and the ability for the voters to discern who's really behind it and another very well-intention bill that I think also has some flaws in it that worries me in terms of moving it forward to the Governor.",0.0
False,,"So with that, reluctantly, I'm not going to be able to support this bill today, not because I don't think that we have a problem with money in our elections, but because I think that there are ways on which the local government can responsively deal with it if they see it is a problem, and because I think the bigger issue facing the voters is the issue of disclosure, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Yes. Thank you, Madam President, again I appreciate the thoughtful advocacy by the Senator from the west side, but I thought that the two examples that were used were worthy of a response. Both of them dealt with elected leaders who were actually criminal, they were engaged in conduct that was criminal conduct and certainly that's not anything that I would sanction by indicating this legislation was not the answer that they would suggest. If you have criminal conduct, no laws is necessarily going to stop that from happening. So if someone wants to take a contribution under the table or take a contribution over the limit and fails to disclose it.",0.0
False,,"Or whatever other shenanigans that might take place, it's not anything that I would ever suggest as appropriate and this legislation will really do nothing to stop that. I know that each of us has to decide this issue of limits from what the state should tell locals to do, and what they should on their own right decide for themselves and I appreciate and respect that we will all define those boundaries in different ways under different issues, but for me, every local jurisdiction today can set their limits at whatever level. The Senator from Agoura Hills indicates that city in her district has set it at a lower amount, that's fine and in larger jurisdictions they may set it at a higher amount.",0.0
False,,"But is it really up to us to tell them that this is something that they must address. The good government folks, many friends of mine who are the sponsors of this bill could go to every jurisdiction in our districts, and ask them to set limits. We don't need this legislation to do that and that's why I think it's unnecessary.",0.0

Without this measure, we will continue to debate this matter and it may be a year or more before we get to some agreement down the road.

False,,"You gave me a lot of wonderful advice. For example, I know now that occasionally, this happened in public safety with our wonderful Senator Hancock, where there was a point in time where there was nobody there to chair the meeting because everybody was covering other bills. And they would give the gavel to me.",0.0
False,,"It's like I knew what I was doing. But I have studied Isadore's chairmanship very, very closely. As I know many of you have, as well. And so you may say if I get the opportunity to have the gavel, that was Isadore.",0.0
False,,"So one of my favorite Isadores is to say after the Senator or the Assembly Member, and this happens a lot more with Assembly members, I noticed Presents there as Isadore would say and now I'm practicing, I would say family member, your bill enjoys the support of the chair.",0.0
False,,So I would suggest you guide your witnesses in regard to their testimony going forward. I love that. We all understood what that meant and I'm going to try to follow that wonderful guidance that Isadore has given me in sharing committees.,0.0
False,,"You know that if I did anything right in my first year and a half here, it was because of my good friend Isadore Hall's guidance. And if I did anything wrong and there might have been a few missteps, it had nothing to do with Isadore. You have full deniability my friend on all those things. Isadore's immediately agreed to co sponsor two of my earliest bills on the confederacy, name on public places and we jointly author the bullet button billed together, and that was a real tribute.",0.0
False,,"It wasn't such an easy street because there was a lot of hate that came our way, and I always could turn to my brother, Isadore, to see what kind of hate was coming his way and commiserate about that. And it was very supportive. Environment that you provided to me.",0.0
False,,"When you carry a tough bill, not everybody's happy and everybody has their own way of expressing it. But when you have Isadore at your back, you know you're in a really good spot. I loved our bowtie Thursdays. That was pretty fun. Yeah, my vote size ready to come out.",0.0
False,,"You're not going to be here. I don't want to forward, but I'm going to try to keep it going, my friend. Nobody has more style on this floor than my brother, Isadore Hall. Is that true, folks? Come on, you can clap now. No better style. No better grace than Senator Leno. No better style than Isadore Hall. Amen to that. I'll tell you what though, to put all the fun aside,",0.0
False,,"the thing that I will always remember about Isadore is that when it came to district issues that warm smile, that wonderful embrace that I'm going to miss so much is gone. He is one tough cookie when he is fighting for his district and they're going to have no better fighter for them than Isadore Hall in our great capital in Washington DC. So, he is a guy you want in his corner.",0.0
False,,"I love his warmth and affection, it's contagious. I love that fighting spirit when it comes to representing the people and getting things done for your district. I'm going to miss this guy, I'll miss you brother Hall.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Madam Chairman.",0.0
False,,"So a challenge for all of us now, it's late in the evening and",0.0
False,,we're getting stuff that we haven't had a chance to look at very carefully and review.,0.0
False,,And that certainly applies to this bill as well.,0.0
False,,"I guess I'd like to ask how long as this, I guess questions to the author if I may.",0.0
False,,So how long has these Amendments been out in prints?,0.0
False,,We just got them a couple minutes ago.,0.0
False,,"Okay, so the challenge for all of us.",0.0
False,,"Okay, so the challenge is, and I mean this with all respect, but there's a lot of people that have an interest in this subject matter and",0.0
False,,what is our ability to have their input to the deliberations that we're having now?,0.0
False,,"Well, certainly this affects almost every city in California, right. This applies to every city. So I don't know how many cities we have, but there's a lot.",0.0
False,,So for example the league of cities. The league of cities. They had a chance to take a look at the bill? Yes.,0.0
False,,And do they have a thought you could share?,0.0
False,,I believe that the league of cities is neutral on the bill.,0.0
False,,Are there any cities that are in opposition to the bill? Have you heard of other input from any other city?,0.0
False,,"And, has there been a cost estimate of what this bill would cost cities to implement this?",0.0
False,,Do you have any sense of that?,0.0
False,,"Thank you, Madam President and members. I also reluctantly rise in opposition to this bill. I also appreciate the great work of our part time faculty, they are critical to our community colleges and our state universities. They're the ones that are more responsive to the changing interest of students. The ability to teach courses that kids want.",0.0
False,,"It's going to put those monies at risk if a community college district doesn't do what they can happen today. That there can be unionization, there can be collective bargaining in every one of these community college districts for part time faculty. We don't need this legislation to do that. But the analysis goes on to say that the laws of the SSS fee funds could be costly.",0.0
False,,"Specially given the significant investment state was made with these funds to implement strategies, to incentivize successful student behaviors. And they conclude by saying that this measure will dilute these funds which are intended for critical academic support services for students. So with that, I would reluctantly encourage a no vote.",0.0
False,,"Let's go Mr. Wilk, next, and then Miss Gonzales.",0.0
False,,"counties in this state that don't have an OB/GYN. Certified midwives, for decades, have been doing this kind of work in a safe way, with the same kinds of outcomes. The story that was just told about about the baby being born in a pool of blood was done by a GYN. So I'm not sure, it seems to me that a nurse midwife practicing in a same hospital arena as",0.0
False,,"an MD, who has the same level of support around them. Again members this, the outcomes have been studied across the country. There are no difference in outcomes of safety. The idea that mid wives are only giving birth at home is erroneous. They are also giving birth in the hospital. The same level of practice as anybody else.",0.0
False,,"All right, are there anybody else in opposition? All right.  Assemblyman, I want to give you the chance to respond to some of the concerns that have been raised.",0.0
False,,"Commenting on a bill is different than trying to construct, deconstructive and molding it and changing it to way you think it workable and resolves a lot of the issues that you have raised.",0.0
False,,"If you support state licensing and you think that there is some conflicts or overlaps, you need language to be proposed for him to consider, because none of us like this situation that we're in at this moment under deadline pressure with an inability to change this bill without killing it and then to hear that there was an offer made to consider changes. And yet, there were none forthcoming.",0.0
False,,"I think it was a missed opportunity. Assemblyman Stone, we've talked about what the feds may do that can create potential conflicts and I understand that and I understand how you want to handle it next year, but there are some other concerns that worry me a little bit in terms of existing rules being in conflict.",0.0
False,,"And I think about this in terms of the student's point of view, which again, you're deserving a great praise for trying to protect the students who are borrowers and are making sure that this is really all about them and how we can be sure that they can fulfill their obligations in a fair manner not be exploited.",0.0
False,,"One of them deals with when, if the conflict in your bill could set up a situation where a borrower has to send their payments to different parties and that the bills's requirements regarding the timing and content of the required notifications differ with federal regulation.",0.0
False,,You don't necessarily have control over that right? That's them-,0.0
False,,"And I would hate to see your efforts lose a year, and lose at least a framework or a structure that you will then work within, and we will work within, to improve in the course of the next 18 months, before it goes into effect.",0.0
False,,"There's certainly, is a changing environment. But we are dealing with a very important function that goes on in our state that affects a lot of kids due to the many loans that are out there. I worry mostly about the confusion to the students and the borrowers.",0.0
False,,"That's the last thing we really want to do is to create that confusion for them. They're the most vulnerable to that, that problem. But I find myself being convinced by you that it's better to move now to create a framework to get the regulatory side focused on how to make it work.",0.0
False,,I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to adjust and modify next year as this thing goes forward and we see what the feds are doing.,0.0
False,,Purely coincidental. Welcome.,0.0
False,,"All right, we have one more bill on call. It's Assembly Bill 2251 by Stone. Chair is aye, the Vice-Chair is no, the current vote is 4 votes in favor, 2 votes against. Would you call the roll please?",0.0
False,,"Madame President, for purposes of lost and found.",0.0
False,,So your intentions are to go through every bill on call and then close the roll on each of those bills?,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin, on behalf of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. In respect to your admonition not to discuss Prop 61, let me start, on November 9th, the day after the election. Things will either be exactly the same or they will change dramatically. And we urge the Legislature, looking at the results on November 8th, to help guide it as it goes froward. We really appreciate your commitment to this isssue Mr. Chair and the fact that you're having additional hearings on this is a very promising sign.",0.0
False,,"But on November 9th, you may be given direction by the people of California. We urge this Committee and the Legislature as a whole to make sure that the State of California implements the will of the voters in as aggressive and a robust manner as possible, to insure that it's done with integrity and to provide tools to the State to implement the direction of the voters, effectively.",0.0
False,,"If the voters do not send any direction to the Legislature, the reality is this is not an issue that's going away. Kaiser Family Foundation issued a survey last week, said 74% of Americans think that this is the number one issue. 63% of Americans think that government needs to take action to lower drug prices. Those numbers are similar to numbers in California as well.",0.0
False,,"So it's an issue that the voters care about, and the voters would like to see the Legislature do something. So this is the beginning, Mr. Chair, and thank you again, to address this issue. We stand ready to work with you however November 8th turns out from the Oval Office on down relative to this issue and make sure that this is fixed once and for all. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair and members, Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for holding this hearing on a very important topic. I wasn't going to say anything, but we did hear some very interesting testimony from a representative from one of the drug companies. Much of it was a deflection on everyone, including my trade Association members and much of that was also incompatible with the rigorous body of federal and state law that governs this area.",0.0
False,,"Particularly, copay limitations, benefit design rules, and the inability of plans and insures to change premiums or benefit structure throughout the policy year. Drug companies, of course, are allowed to increase their prices many times throughout the year. But in any case, we do look forward to a future hearing or our direct conversations with you to just respond to that presentation of reality, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Welcome to the front of the room my colleague from the Assembly, Chairman Matt Debabneh. Chair of the Assembly Banking and Finance Committee held a hearing earlier this year. Actually last month, which was very informative and Chairman Debabneh it's great to have you here.",0.0
False,,"I want to thank everyone who is in attendance this morning, especially the witnesses who have agreed to make a special trip here after the Thanksgiving holiday. I appreciate that, the extra effort to be a part of this hearing. I want to say from the onset that I have great appreciation for Wells Fargo's place in California's history, and for the vital role that they have played in our commerce and our economy.",0.0
False,,"Wells iconic stagecoach takes us back to a time when banks were held in high esteem and trust. Yet, here we are today wondering how one of the nation's great banks has come to such disgrace, how it failed its most priced asset, its customers. Wells Fargo set up an incentivized system of rewards and punishments through its staff at every level.",0.0
False,,"This pressure led to the creation of phony accounts, and illicit fees being charged to customers on a massive scale. This affected up to 2 million accounts. Nearly 900,000 in California alone. The financial cost to consumers was in the millions of dollars, but the loss in trust is untold.",0.0
False,,"The financial meltdown of 2008 showed us that when we lose trust in our banks, our economy moves towards the presuppose. Wells Fargo's actions go way beyond a few rogue employees and customer accounts.",0.0
False,,"The scale of abuse strikes at the heart of the public's ability to trust this bank and the banking system. I want to make it clear to you that I was not set on holding a hearing today. Especially after Assembly Banking and Finance chaired by Mr. Debabneh held his, but my questions for Wells Fargo still have not been adequately answered.",0.0
False,,"In fact they've fallen well short of the accountability that the public expects. As Chairman of the Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee, I have a responsibility to ensure that we have clarity on what happened, how deep the problem, who's responsible beyond the CEO who resigned under pressure and the 5300 employees who were fired.",0.0
False,,"And whether the changes that Wells Fargo has made are truly reformative, were just band aids to make the public relations problem to go away. So I'm here seeking answers to questions that Wells Fargo has yet to address, even during the September congressional hearings.",0.0
False,,"I did meet with Wells Fargo personally about six weeks ago. And I ask them the questions that everyone is asking, customers, regulators, law makers. Why did employees knowingly falsify customer counts? Who knew about it and when?",0.0
False,,What actions were taken to hold those responsible? What did the board of directors know and what actions did they take? Why was there a failure to disclose material problems to customers regulators and investors? And why when all the information points to a breakdown in ethics by the management chain of the bank?,0.0
False,,"Did the directors appoint a Wells Insider to oversee the current investigation disclosure and repair? Despite follow-up correspondence between the bank and me, much of which is released in the Committee staff report, I remain dissatisfied on every material question. The bank has failed to provide complete information.",0.0
False,,"Let me address some of these questions in more detail. A Senior Vice President of the bank told me that he had no idea why so many employees at the bank cheated people, he pointed to sales incentives as a possible cause of the problem and reviewed the gradual elimination of sales goals. As a way to clean it up.",0.0
False,,"But he could point to no hard data collected by the bank to precisely identify why the chain of command within the bank failed to stop the abuse. The bank has made it clear that they knew there was a problem as early as 2011. But despite this information, and so called continued reforms including the creation of a sales and service oversight team in 2013.",0.0
False,,"Wells Fargo officials admit the reforms were ineffective but they still act as if they did enough to absolve themselves. In dense CEO stumps to remark to Congress in September, he gave every impression that the fraudulent behavior was predominantly by individuals at low levels within the bank and not part of a wider culture.",0.0
False,,He acknowledged that some of the managers were involved but gave very few specifics. That tactic had obvious benefits. If managers of the bank cooperated or colluded in the fraud. Then the problems would touch much closer to the leadership and culture of the bank.,0.0
False,,"After my Senate Banking Committee staff and I pushed for more specific answers, we now have additional information about the extent of the scandal, and it clearly touches management staff. In response to our first round of questions, Wells now says, that more than 480 managers were fired in the last five years due to sales practice violations.",0.0
False,,"We're told these individuals were branch managers and above. This disclosure that 480 highly trained and competent leaders of the bank, engaged in this misconduct is deeply troubling. In it's written response to the United States Senate Committee on banking, housing and urban affairs, Wells shows that it employed 5,816 store managers.",0.0
False,,"We refer to them as branch managers. As of September 1st, 2016. The firing of 480 persons with the rank of manager and above seems to represent a breakdown of fair and honest dealing at an extraordinary scale.",0.0
False,,"And keep in mind that these are the only ones whose conduct Wells thought constituted a firing offense. We don't know what other conduct Wells excused by other leaders of the company. And I want to reference a submittal to Congress just a few weeks ago on page 44, in this regard.",0.0
False,,"And Wells said this in their submittal. Just one second here. So on page 44, they said this. The termination over the last five years have included 483 managers up to three levels above bankers and tellers. When investigators have found that managers engaged in or directed improper sales practices, or exhibited excessive pressure.",0.0
False,,"And then here's an important copy out that they included. And did not respond properly and decisively to change their behavior. So they fired 483 managers who directed or engaged in improper sales practices but they didn't fire additional individuals, who, perhaps, apologized for that conduct.",0.0
False,,"Basically, making the point that there are still people employed at high levels of Wells Fargo that did engage and direct this type of illegal activity. Now, I want to acknowledge that after Wells Fargo entered into a settlement agreement, with local and federal regulators, they've taken a number of important actions.",0.0
False,,They retained an outside accounting firm to audit all of their accounts to identify and fully reimburse every customer for any fee associated with an unauthorized account. They have agreed to make whole any customer who might have had credit problems due to an unauthorized account.,0.0
False,,"They've also pledged to eliminate sales based incentive compensation goals for employees within their consumer banking arm. Additionally, Wells Fargo board of directors has taken some action to claw back executive pay and they've also announced their own investigation into some of these issues, which they claim will be lead by independent directors.",0.0
False,,"Clearly, one of the big disappointments of this entire scandal is the lack of responsible oversight by Wells Fargo's board of directors. I've asked Wells to detail actions by the board of directors who root out this problem. They've come forward with zero information.",0.0
False,,"How could a board of such distinguished individuals failed to monitor and hold management accountable for such a wide ranging scandal? One of my goals is to have Wells Fargo acknowledge the extent of the problem, to come clean on how pervasive that scheme was, that it was not a handful of renegade lower-level bankers going rogue to book unsuspecting customers.",0.0
False,,"This appears to have been company culture, an atmosphere of greed pushed from the top. And Wells Fargo must provide a blueprint on how it expects to clean it up. It's the only way to do right by its customers, but also to regain the trust of the public that is foundational to the existence of banks and financial institutions. Before i call up our first witness, I want to address the absence of Wells Fargo today.",0.0
False,,"Your agenda shows Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan as an invited witness. It does not show that Wells Fargo has declined this invitation. I opted to leave Wells Fargo on the agenda to give them the opportunity to change their minds and I hope that they would. If Mr. Sloan is here I'd like him to, I'd like to invite him to join us now at the witness table.",0.0
False,,"I checked with the Senate Historian a few minutes ago and I asked the question, when was the last time that a company refused to participate in an oversight hearing of the Senate? And the answer was the last company that refused to do that was Enron.",0.0
False,,It's sad to see Wells Fargo join this elite hall of shame. Trust and honest dealings are fundamental principals in our financial services industry. It's our job as representatives of the people to ensure that those trusted with the public's money are accountable for adhering to the highest standards of conduct.,0.0
False,,"We need Wells to own up to their shortcomings. Their unwillingness to stand before this Committee is a sign of bad faith with their customers, and all of California. I know that my colleagues in the California Legislature will not be deterred by the banks duck and hide behavior as we seek answers at this hearing and at future hearings.",0.0
False,,"Who could imagine that a bank that represented the values of honesty and fair dealings for more than 160 years in California would now become an outlaw institution? With that I'd like to invite my colleague in the Assembly, Chairman of the banking Committee Chairman Dababneh, to make any opening remarks.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Chair Debabneh. So I'd like to invite Michael Bostrom, the Managing Assistant City Attorney, from the Affirmative Litigation Division Office of Los Angeles City, Attorney Mike Feuer to come join us with this table, thank you. Michael, Mr. Bostrom thank you very much for being here.",0.0
False,,"Thank you. Mr Bostrom, thank you so much for being here. And thank you, and your Boss, the City Attorney Feuer, for such good work in trying to get to the bottom of these problems. I wanted to ask a couple of follow up questions if I may.",0.0
False,,"You talked about the process that you went through in your investigations. Can you put some time to that? Actual date stamp some of those steps so I could be clearer, and we could be clearer about when you began, when you initiated your litigation, etc.",0.0
False,,Does that mean that you didn't inform Wells Fargo of your investigation? They weren't aware of it at that time?,0.0
False,,"So, when did Wells Fargo become aware of your investigations?",0.0
False,,"So in 2015, you filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo and you think that was the first time in which they became aware of your inquiry?",0.0
False,,"So Wells Fargo, they never in any of their SEC filings provided information of that investigation that was taking place. They determined that it wasn't considered to be material. Do you have any thoughts about that?",0.0
False,,"And did you find after you filed your lawsuit that Wells Fargo became cooperative in providing additional information about what had happened, from their point of view?",0.0
False,,And do you have any observations through the work that you did about how far into the hierarchy of Wells Fargo this problem existed?,0.0
False,,And did you use that in any judgements that you made in terms of what the appropriate fine that was put in effect in this case?,0.0
False,,So your point there regarded the email contact was that there was a flashing red light that was easily seen by people throughout the organization in terms of the setting up of these accounts?,0.0
False,,"That they provided? So they had it in their possession, and this is in the 2015 timeframe?",0.0
False,,"So, why is it that you in the settlement that you agreed to that Wells Fargo avoided an admission of guilt?",0.0
False,,"Okay, there's been some questions raised about these sales practices in the retail bank, but there are incentive programs throughout the bank in other areas. Did you look at that at all?",0.0
False,,"So the fact that you didn't come forth with any charges doesn't mean that was, the fact that they didn't exist, it's just you simply didn't look into them to know whether those problems existed in other places?",0.0
False,,"Good, thank you. Chairman Dababneh, do you have any questions?",0.0
False,,"Senator Galgiani, welcome.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, that's a good question, Senator, and I don't know the answer to it. I do know that, and if Wells was here, they would testify to the fact that they significantly reduced their incentive program over the course of the last five years. And yet, it still didn't seem to change the problems of fraud that continued to go on in the bank.",0.0
False,,"But I don't know the broader question about the industry. Mm-hm, okay. There may be people here representing the financial world that would come under public testimony, could provide some clarification about it if they have some knowledge of that.",0.0
False,,"Any other questions from? You're good? Okay, Chairman Debabneh?",0.0
False,,"Thank you, any other questions? Mr. Bostrom, thank you again for taking the time to come up here. Thanks for all your good work.  Appreciate it very much. For those members of the public that are here, there are some additional information packets that have been placed on the desk here in the front if you'd like additional background for this hearing.",0.0
False,,"Our panel number two incorporates a number of distinguished individuals that I'd like to invite to come and join us today. Aeisha Mastagni, who is the Portfolio Manager, corporate governance California State Teachers Retirement System, welcome. Steve Juarez, the Deputy Treasurer, economic development and higher education policy.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Ms. Mastagni. A couple follow up questions, you've raised this issue of unnecessary incentives, or incentives that can create too much pressure.  Do you have any sense of that in regards to Wells Fargo here in terms of whether their incentives have been set at the right place?",0.0
False,,Thank you and do you recall what Wells Fargo's response was to your concern about KMPG being retained as an Auditor for 85 years at that company.,0.0
False,,And do you know of other examples in the financial services industry where you have an Auditor retained for that long period of time?,0.0
False,,And we appreciate you doing that. You mentioned the issue of being over boarded and you only mentioned the CEO as one example. Are there other examples on the The Wells Fargo Board?,0.0
False,,"Great, thank you for sharing that. In judging the effectiveness of a board, it's hard for us in the public space, because we're not sitting there in the room and these discussions for the most part, happen in private. So it's a challenging way to evaluate.",0.0
False,,"I guess that when you see a train crash, you start looking closely at who are the conductors. But until that point in time, you don't really know whether that oversight is appropriate. And it's part of the challenge that you have as a big investor and we all have as a public oversight group.",0.0
False,,"I'm going to ask you to get out of your comfort zone perhaps on this question, and I would understand it if you want to defer. But given the information that's come out regarding the extent of this scandal, of this fraud, the numbers being so high, 5,300 employees fired including 480 managers.",0.0
False,,"We are not presently aware of any document, any document or instance, prior to the settlement with the CFPB, that informed the Board of the total number of employees who had been terminated for misconduct relating to improper sales practices.",0.0
False,,"And Wells Fargo has previously testified that of those 5,300, they were firing about 1,000 a year, over the course of five years. And they have not provided the information showing the timeline of the firing of the management levels or above, so that's unclear.",0.0
False,,"But given that volume of terminations for unethical sales practices, does it surprise you that they never provided the board with any document, or as they say, instance, informing them of the extent of this problem?",0.0
False,,"And the board has said they're engaging in their so-called independent review. Do you have any observations about what would give us confidence in you as a a major investor, confidence that an independent review has been properly carried out?",0.0
False,,"Great, thank you. Any other questions from our panel members? Assemblyman Dababneh.",0.0
False,,And you sit on the board on behalf of the treasurer of CalSTRS and CalFirst as well.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Schaefer, Mr. Juarez thank you both for being here. One follow-up question if I may to, I think it might be best to Mr. Shaffer you talked about the sanctions. And you provided a summary of the examples in which California has Wells Fargo securities or has used Wells Fargo as an underwriter.",0.0
False,,Do you have a sense of the scope of that service that work that Wells Fargo does for other public agencies in California?,0.0
False,,"So I, and I don't mean to understate the financial impact of a California has done under the leadership of Treasurer Chiang. I was only trying to understand whether or not, while we've seen some individual entities act on their own, has the treasury given any consideration to communicating with the vast array of public entities that do exist in California, that are floating bonds, that are investing, and the like, to join him in his effort to make the impact of this kind of-",0.0
False,,"And do you have any thoughts, were there to be a law proposed that would say that if a financial institution came under some level of penalty, that rather than a choice by the treasurer or a local entity to avoid that institution, to put a provision in to law that would create those types of sanctions automatically, where some threshold to be reached, any thoughts on that?",0.0
False,,"Good. Question, Senator Galgiani?",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Senator, Chair Dababneh.",0.0
False,,"Great, thank you. And the panel members, thank you all for being here and for your insight. Much appreciated, thank you. Okay, we're going to go to the last panel, but nevertheless, an important one, before this Committee.",0.0

False,,"Drawing attention to the fact that the office of the Comptroller of the Currency has not given Wells Fargo a new CRA rating in eight years. The bank's last yearly exam was conducted in 2012.

The wonderful staff of the Banking Committee for all the good work that they have done in preparing the background materials.",0.0
False,,"Certainly want to thank my colleague in the Assembly chair, Dababneh for his work in this area, and I know his concerns have been expressed as part of the hearing process today. Probably the most difficult thing about this hearing, is that we all know that Wells Fargo employs tens of thousands of Californians.",0.0
False,,"Made up of wonderful people working hard everyday to do their work and in an honest fashion. And I know that for them, this process that we're going through and then examining what happened and why, and who's responsible, it must be particularly difficult because they've committed so much to this institution that's so important to them, their families, and our communities.",0.0
False,,"And so, I want to acknowledge that, that this is difficult to go through.

False,,"So basically each wave or release building upon one another working its way up to 100%. And as you could see, as of the July 2016 release less than half of the project was implemented in terms of these three metrics. As you move forward to the 2017-18 release, you see a much steeper",0.0

Again, I would just reiterate though, we'd hope the legislature avoid legislative measures that are designed to lessen a plan's ability or a payer's ability to appropriately employ utilization management techniques on high-priced drugs.

False,,"I just want to take a few minutes and give you sort of a brief overview of what our thinking was in terms of the allocations. And what limitations we faced when we were doing that, the first in terms of a legal restriction, we were mindful of the single subject rule that we have in California. That requires that initiatives, all the provisions within an initiative, are reasonably germane to each other.",0.0
False,,"And so from our purposes as the lawyers, we wanted to make sure that where we allocated the tax revenues had some connection to the main purpose of the initiative which was to decriminalize marijuana. If we violate the single subject rule, the entire initiative is invalidated. So we made a risk assessment there and we wanted to make sure we were careful on how we allocated that money.",0.0
False,,"From a policy perspective, of course the members of the coalition had significant input on how we allocated those monies. We had significant outreach with various groups that includes social justice groups, drug policy alliance and others, environmental groups. A number of environmental groups gave us extensive feedback which we incorporated by and large into the initiative. And then the state and local governments also provided input which was incorporated into the initiative.",0.0
False,,"In addition to that, at the time we were drafting the initiative, the Lieutenant Governor's blue ribbon Commission on marijuana policy was holding stakeholder meetings around the state, receiving input. We looked at other states, and one of the lessons we felt that we Learned was that it would be a mistake to treat the new revenues we generate as sort of a panacea for all of California's financial woes and instead the best approach would be to direct it at specific purposes.",0.0
False,,"That's in the Blue Ribbon Commission report and I think we've seen that experience in other states, so that was part of our thinking as well. Then finally during the drafting process we reached out and received significant feedback on the tax structure and the allocations from the Board of Equalization.",0.0
False,,"So we tried to engage them during the drafting process to make sure that they were able to provide their feedback to us before the initiative went final. The final point I want to make, this dove tails with something Drew just mentioned, we're also mindful that we want to provide some measure of flexibility for the Legislature with respect to the allocation of the tax revenues over time. And so, that is what lead to the provision that does allow the Legislature to reallocate the money after 10 years.",0.0
False,,"And in addition to that, we do provide that the Legislature may, by a two thirds vote, amend the initiative consistent with the purposes and intent. And those are my prepared remarks. I'm happy to answer questions.",0.0
False,,"Well, based on stakeholder input there were a few preferences that we put in. The community reinvestment money, obviously, a portion of that money, 50% of that account needs to go to qualified nonprofits to assist communities that have been disproportionately impacted by prior drug policies. So that's one preference that was built into the initiative.",0.0
False,,"With respect to youth education, treatment and prevention, we do fund programs to reduce drop out rates in schools and high schools. And that money is supposed to be prioritized, obviously, to schools that have higher drop out rates than others. So there are areas in the initiative where we specify a preference.",0.0
False,,"With respect to the Legislature's role I would say that the Legislature could by a two-thirds vote, further define various terms within those programs. So if we use a term, for example, a system navigation services is a term that is used in the community reinvestment bucket, it's not defined. The Legislature would have the ability to define that.",0.0

False,,Precisely.,0.0
False,,"Well, I appreciate the question, Senator, and certainly, it's a difficult issue and there aren't any easy answers to it. With respect to the initiative, at the time we were crafting it, we did have guidance from the federal Department of Justice. Eight points of federal enforcement priorities, and we stuck very closely to those. We made it a point of emphasis, to ensure that the initiative put a structure in place that met all of those federal enforcement criteria.",0.0
False,,"So we were protected, at least under the Cole Memo, the Ogden Memo, to the extent that those applied. And then what we also did in the initiative, which is somewhat unique with respect to initiatives, is by giving the Legislature the ability to add additional amendments, additional protections, we gave you the ability to add those types of protections to the extent",0.0
False,,"they become necessary to protect, to the extent we can, against federal intervention. Some of this is a matter of simply the supremacy clause. There are things that the federal government can do that we cannot prevent at the state, and that's just a reality of our structure. But we did give you the flexibility to address some of those concerns in the future.",0.0
False,,"I know you've talked before, earlier this morning, about the concerns about an all cash business. We can't solve the banking problem, obviously that's a federal issue. But what we did do is, we were mindful of that. We have provisions in the initiative that require minimum security requirements for retailers, for distributors throughout the chain,",0.0
False,,"to try and recognize the fact that this is an all cash business. We give the regulators the authority to impose additional requirements at the regulatory level to prevent carjacking, as something you mentioned, or other security breaches. And then of course you have the ability to add additional requirements to that.",0.0
False,,"Taking your last point first, I've certainly been not involved in any discussion about trying to challenge that. In light of, I think we are about up to nine states, that have now legalized recreation use of marijuana. We use the term legalize, we are actually decriminalizing at the state level. And to me that's a significant difference, because although its not legal under federal law, we are not compelled, as California, to continue making it illegal here in California.",0.0
False,,"We've chosen not to, and so, part of that decision of course is that local governments and state governments can't be compelled to enforce these federal laws. We have made a different choice, that's how I sort of-",0.0
False,,"That's the way we framed it, yes.",0.0
False,,"the tax rates, whether they're accomplishing the purposes of the initiative and then it's within the Legislature's authority certainly, I think, to require that there be additional over sight over how the money is been allocated and spent. Nothing in the initiative defense fund.",0.0
False,,"Well, I think, taking the tax piece of that first. What the initiative does? And again, we consulted with BOE in crafting the tax section is it explicitly empowers the Board of Equalization to determine the method and manner of payment of the tax. So the tax rate may become effective January 1st, 2018.",0.0
False,,"But if the infrastructure was not in place to immediately begin collecting those taxes, the BOE has regulatory authority to delay collection of the tax until such future time as they feel they are prepared to do that. So the initiative actually, it does already afford that authority. With respect to delayed implementation beyond January 1st,",0.0
False,,"we anticipated that there may be some desire to delay that implementation date. That's why we include a provisional license as one of the types of licenses. So if the regulatory agencies aren't fully prepared to issue full 12-month licenses by January 1st, they have the flexibility to issue temporary licenses as a bridge prior to full licensure.",0.0
False,,"And I think that's actually consistent with one thing that the initiative does which is require by September 1st of 2017 that there is a public, essentially a public information outreach program that is implemented in the state to inform the public what is permissible under the initiative and what's not. And that would include, of course, what the plan is for implementation on the business side.",0.0

The Arkansas National Guard, under orders from the Governor and an angry mob of about 400, surrounded the school and prevented them from going in. On September 23rd, 1957, a mob of about 1,000 people surrounded the school again as the students attempted to enter. The following day, President Dwight D Eisenhower took control of the Arkansas National Guard from the Governor and sent soldiers to accompany the students to school for protection. Soldiers were deployed at the school for the entirety of the school year.",0.0

False,,"Thank you, Madame Chair, and this may sound like Senator Beall and I are working together, but I will give you a practical example. I worked several years in the City of Los Angeles. I left as Director of real estate. I've actually built a detention jails facility in the City of LA. There was a time when the City of Los Angeles allowed police departments and fire departments to help when we got a bond from the citizens. The elected officials decided what the parameters were to be for particular police station.",0.0
False,,"They allowed the police captains and the fire captains to kind of manage the construction project and what we ended up with was a mess, a lot of the police stations didn't come in on time or on budget, probably most of them and so the Mayor and the City Council decided that they would take it out of their hands and they would allow only the Department of Public Works, because what happens is, with implementation, with known conditions construction projects, things can go awry in a lot of ways.",0.0
False,,"And the thing that bothered the elected officials, the people that were elected by their constituents was once they decided the overall idea of what that fire police station would be, it would go drastically the other way. As I look at all of these projects, because one of my question really is about if the BSCC and all the construction that we're doing, even that Committee we talked about. I don't think I heard about having an engineer that would sit with you to tell you whether or not for example this list of 10, 7 and 9. From my experience, all of them can have visitation. All of them can have in-person visitation.",0.0
False,,"And you can require that, whether it's a dollar amount or whether you force them to do it within the parameters of what you were told they needed to do.

False,,"And they either have to eat that amount or we have what is called callbacks and I don't think you have callbacks in any of our state construction projects, whereby if they don't follow the parameters of what we want, we can either hold the money or we can pull money back and make sure that we get exactly what we want and so I just need to know, do we have anything like that in the BSCC? Do we have anything like that in the state where we have people overlooking all of these construction projects that we do to ensure that the state and more important, the voters get exactly what they want?",0.0

In 2009, the panel declared that prison overcrowding was the primary reason why the state was unable to provide adequate care.

False,,"And in 2014, the panel ordered the state to develop and implement various population reduction measures, to achieve and maintain compliance with the cap. If you turn to page two, you'll see that the state has used and continues to use various other means in addition to the court-ordered measures,",0.0
False,,"to reach and maintain compliance with the cap. These include housing inmates in contracted facilities, because contracted facilities don't count toward the capped population. And constructing additional capacity in the state-owned and operated prisons to increase their design capacity and therefore, increase the number of inmates that the state is allowed to hold in these facilities under the cap.",0.0

False,,Question to finance. There were a lot of reasons that were offered at the time for realignment. Not the least of which was the federal court order for reducing our prison population. But part of that conversation was about how our costs at the state level were so much higher than incarceration at the county level.,0.0
False,,"And at least at the time, that I recall, the numbers that were offered up was that it cost about 50,000 to house a person in a state prison. And only about 30,000 at the county level. And so what confuses me a little bit about all this,",0.0
False,,"as I hear the testimony that you've offered, where adding one or subtracting one inmate at a state prison has a $9,500 incremental cost, marginal costs. $29,000 for a contracted bed. It seems to go counter to the suggestions that at",0.0

False,,"All right, but that might've been a false standard in which to evaluate realignment, at least as it relates to the cost savings issue. I appreciate that there were many other elements being proposed or being suggested as the positives out of it.

False,,"All right, the last question I had was looking at the salaries, benefits, and retirement number that has grown so substantially. Could you break down those costs into those categories? How much of that 1.1 billion increase in the last five years is relating to retirement obligations?",0.0
False,,And how much of that is related to the category of salaries and benefits?,0.0
False,,"All right, because that then gives us some sense of what we have some control over, right? Given current court cases and the like. The retirement obligation is not something we have any control over. But the salaries and benefits, 719 million is something that we do have some level of control over, right?",0.0

With regards to the budget we've looked at the projections of their caseload hours per case and other cost drivers and raise no concerns at this time We will provide updates as the estimates are updated in May.

False,,"And in this presentation, I'll discuss both the fiscal and policy implications. So for the first policy implications on page 10 of the agenda, we note that as the administration has noted, the elimination of the IHSS MOE will result in the shift of over $600 million of cost back to counties.",0.0
False,,"This, as a result, represents a number of short term and long term considerations. Mainly because the traditional funds that counties rely on, 1991 realignment revenues, won't be enough to cover this immediate increase in cost. The administration is, to our understanding, currently in negotiations with counties to find ways to mitigate some of these financial challenges they may face.",0.0
False,,"As for the Legislature, there are a number of ways that you could also provide relief. In the report we outline, one specific recommendation is changing the current cap on wages and benefits. Currently, counties are responsible for wage and benefit cost that exceed $12.10. One option is to perhaps link the cap to statewide the minimum wage of that current year.",0.0
False,,"I do have a colleague with me that can talk more about the technical aspects of any relief that would require changes to 1991 realignment funding structure. But overall, this determination of the IHSS MOE, will thus present a number of fiscal challenges to counties, given the fact that the realignment revenues will not be enough to cover the immediate cost shift,",0.0
False,,"and that also has implications for their future sustainability of revenues. Moving on to the policy considerations that this then brings up is, in a practical sense, nothing changed with regards to the administration and overall programmatic aspects of IHSS due to the CCI.",0.0
False,,"However, through our research, we did find that there was improved coordination and communication between county administrators and health plans. And this then, in some cases, did manifest itself in expedited reassessment and assessments for consumers. So if the Legislature were interested in either maintaining or further enhancing and",0.0
False,,"building off of some of these initial outcomes, there are a number of ways in which you can do so. One, is perhaps just providing funding to continue some of these coordinations that did occur under the CCI. The administration does signal to some form of support for this, the policy merits. And that, it is encouraging counties to continue the current practices that were in place under CCI, yet there's no funding attached to that.",0.0
False,,"So that's one way in which the Legislature could continue some of the improvements we saw in CCI. On the other end of the spectrum of potential ways to build off of some of these improvements is perhaps pursuing a more fuller robust integration of IHSS under managed care plans, and that can take multiple forms.",0.0
False,,"It mainly depends on the level of authority and control the Legislature Deems fit for managed care plans, which then is determined by what aspects of the IHSS program do you think should be preserved, and maintained, and controlled by the state or the counties.",0.0

False,,"Because ours got cut in 2010 and 2011. We had about a dozen public authorities in the state by 2011 that their total budget, federal state in county was under $100,000. So the reality for us is that we return back to us an unsustainable amount of money and",0.0

False,,"We would like to see re-establishment of state level bargaining for all counties as of July 1st. We believe that this makes the most sense, not only for our members, because right now the system is chaotic. It's not uniform. You have different wages in different counties.",0.0
False,,"Depending on, basically, what the environments in those counties are, the generosity of the benefits, it's a very unfair system and separate from that is that most fiscally responsible for the state to do because in the present system the state has to pay regardless of what the agreement is that is agreed to locally.",0.0
False,,So the state has no input on that. And we all know that wages and benefits account for the vast majority of spending.

I'm just going to reference several figures that are in the report. You can see on Figure 1, page 4 the higher ed system in California.",0.0
False,,"The 1960 master plan for higher education believed at the time that it was making sort of an ideal combination of decisions regarding access mission and costs. The Legislature ever since this plan has continued to be interested in access, mission, and cost. The master plan, conceived at UC and CSU's admissions policies would be aligned to the eligibility pools.",0.0
False,,"The master plan asked UC to draw from the top 12.5% of public high school graduates, and CSU to draw from the top 33%. The data that we have today as of 2015, UC admitting 13% of public high school graduates,",0.0
False,,"that's the data that we have, and CSU admitting 30% of high school graduates. So then we don't actually have what pools they're drawing from but we do know just the aggregate the numbers out there that they're admitting. To give you some context 15 years ago, UC, admitted 12% of high school graduates.",0.0
False,,"So it hasn't changed that much and it's--if it were actually pulling from all of the top students, it would be meeting the master plan goals. CSU 15 years ago was admitting 18% so notably smaller chunk than it is today, so effectively CSU is drawing presumably from a much larger pool today, again, than it was earlier. The state's been interested in this and so it provided some funding for the Office of Planning and Research to do a study to see,",0.0
False,,"well could we get more refined data and see what is UC and CSU actually pulling from. That data was supposed to be available in December. So you might, it's not yet available. You might just want to, in a subsequent hearing, discuss when the results will be available,",0.0
False,,"if they'll be available on time for you to make your enrollment and budget decisions this year. For transfer students, the master plan design that you would take your GE courses with a certain GPA, and you would be able to go on to UC and CSU. And UC says this is what's happening today. Every eligible transfer student's being admitted somewhere in the system.",0.0
False,,"CSU was saying that about 10, 000 eligible transfer students are being turned away, so we are recommending that you go ahead and fund enrolment growth for CSU and target it to transfer students. 1% for example, would be 3600 additional transfer students that would have access to CSU. If CSU were to raise tuition by 2.5% it would have enough money to both cover this cost and cover some other costs that are in their budget.",0.0
False,,Now presumably you're not going to be thrilled. What do you mean raise tuition to try to fund enrollment growth? But as you go through the session you're going to realize how difficult the choices are for you this year with CSU's budget. Non resident enrollment has been a big issue.,0.0
False,,And I think you'll talk about it quite a bit this season. On page six we have some data regarding it. There's also some data in your agenda. For the sake of time I'm going to skip right over it.,0.0
False,,"But we're happy to talk more about it as the season goes on. So the Legislature's remained, obviously, interested in access. So over the last few years, it's taken actions to try to expand access.",0.0
False,,"So for example, one thing it did a few years ago was to create a pilot program in the community colleges that would have them pilot bachelor's degree programs. There's also been some interest in changing CSU's eligibility pool, so more students could go directly to CSU. There's been concerns among the segments. On the one hand it's mission creep for this segment or mission creep for that segment.",0.0
False,,"We would suggest is that if there is a change to mission or to eligibility, given that there are implications for eligibility, for cost, for potential equality and for ripple implications on the other segments, that you just be thoughtful, take your time, deliberate comprehensively, on what the impact to the entire system would be. So turning to affordability, just as a recap, UC has a highest tuition among the three segments.",0.0
False,,"Right now it's roughly $12,000 for a full time student. For CSU, full time it's roughly 5,500 and for community colleges it's a little bit less than 1,500. For UC, if you are to compare them to similar public institutions, they're high. Still lower than private universities by far but high on the public side.",0.0
False,,"For CSU they're much lower than their comparable public institutions. And community colleges remain the lowest in the nation, about one-third of the national average. There are some students that pay this full fee costs, the full tuition level. So if you're seeing you're paying that full tuition cost,",0.0
False,,"you're covering about 52% of the total education cost. If you're paying the full fee at CSU, you're covering 36% and at community colleges, 17%. These don't include federal grants, federal tax credits, deductions, savings plans that are intended to benefit primarily middle income and upper income folks.",0.0
False,,"If you turn to page 12, figure five, you can see financial aid programs for California students. The state's financial aid programs tend to be grants and tend to be focused on tuition. And about 60% of UC and CSU students get full tuition coverage under a state program.",0.0
False,,"At community colleges it's about a little bit less than half of students, but about two thirds of the units taken. So the Legislature has been interested in the last few years particularly in the Assembly about expanding state funding for aid. And we've been asked in the past, well what are some options for how the state might want to do that. And the two options we've repeatedly offered have been on the Cal grant area.",0.0
False,,"So one of the keys we tried to do is to focus on what are remaining areas to access and, remaining barriers I'm sorry, to completion and then try and to get aid money directed as closely as possible to what those barriers are. So there's some concern that low income students are still having to work too much or take on too much debt to complete their programs. And so one way you could address that is by increasing your Cal Grant Access Award which is for financially needy students to effectively cover living cost.",0.0
False,,"Another option is that non-traditional- Yes, exactly, it's a portion of the Cal Grant Bill that goes for living costs, yes. Another option would be for your non-traditional students who right now aren't entitled to a Cal grant because they're too old,",0.0
False,,"they take some time off between high school and community colleges, to expand the number of awards you have for them. Right now there are some of these financially needy non-traditional students who in a state program are getting neither money for education or for living. There's far more applicants than the state has for awards. Turning to performance, the state the last few years have been interested in profiling performance during the budget conversations.",0.0
False,,"Segments now have requirements to collect data Create targets, report outcomes, so just wanted to highlight some of those. On page 16, you can see the outcomes for UC. Unsurprisingly, UC has the best student outcomes among the three statements.",0.0
False,,"They take the most prepared students, tend to be ranking highest in our class. For the CSU, you're going to hear a lot talk about grad rates. You can see from this table if you look at the six-year grad rate for freshmen applicants,",0.0
False,,"they had set a goal a few years ago of having 54% of their students graduate in six years and they beat it. They had 57% graduate within that time period, and they have goals to improve, 62% a few years from now growing to 70% by 2025. Now having said that if you look today, there's still more than 40% of students who want to graduate,",0.0
False,,"who aren't graduating at CSU and we know that about 25% of students, so one in four aren't making that to junior year. So they're starting out as freshmen again and just not making it to year three. So some reasons to be pleased and some reasons to still be vigilant.",0.0
False,,"For community colleges, you can see their outcomes on page 19, and again there's some promising news and some not so promising news. So, if you were to look at their progress getting students from a remedial course to a college level course, they're doing better today than a few years ago.",0.0
False,,"For example in math about several years ago 2010, 11 data they had about 29% of students moved from a remedial to a college level math course. And that's increased over four year period of 33%. But at the same time they're getting more students from remedial to college level courses,",0.0
False,,"they're getting fewer students to actually complete their programs. So if you look at their total program completion rates, a few years ago it was 49%. It's dropped to 47% and has dropped for both prepared and unprepared students. So if you actually turn back to CSU, in addition to looking at performance we've also just been looking at the measures.",0.0
False,,And if the measures themselves are giving the Legislature what it presumably intended. Right now the state has two efficiency measures. One is an excess unit measure. 120 units is what you need to graduate. Anything above that would be a measure of inefficiency.,0.0
False,,"A student somehow isn't seamlessly making it through their four years or six years. So what you can see here, we think the measure is a good one of efficiency. You can see for CSU, despite many efforts to streamline transfer, for example, it actually slightly missed its goal for transfer students,",0.0
False,,"just made its goal for freshman students. But at 140 some units, students are still, on average, taking more than a full extra semester to complete their programs. The other efficiency measure is just right above here, the funding per degree, and if you look at the targets, the goals, they are to receive more funding per degree as time moves forward.",0.0
False,,"So we don't think this is, neither we, nor the segments think this is a particularly good measure of efficiency. Think both of us would like to work with you to see if it could be swapped out with a more meaningful indicator, something like cost per student or cost per degree. Finally, on performance, the state law has expressed interest in measuring outcomes for college graduates.",0.0
False,,"So presumably, college made a difference. We should be able to see that manifested in what happens to students once they leave the schools, but the state right now doesn't have any of these measures for graduate outcomes. So we're encouraging you to think about adding earnings by segment and",0.0
False,,"campus, as well or instead of, an income mobility measure by segment or campus. One or both of these, we think would be a good complement to the existing performance measures. So, turning to the last big area of infrastructure. So you might recall in 13, 14 for UC and 14, 15 for CSU,",0.0
False,,"the state made a significant change to how it financed capital at the universities. Prior to this time, the state put a measure on the ballot. Voters, if they approved it. tate went out, sold GO bonds,",0.0
False,,"paid the debt, serviced, UC/CSU came, we approved their projects. We sold the bond, covered the debt serviced. When the state made this change, it took what the state was paying for",0.0
False,,"debt service on behalf of the segments, rolled it into their main appropriation item. I think the thinking of the Governor at the time was that if we as a state, rolled capital and operations together, the segments would have more incentive to manage and maintain their properties wisely, because now they'd have a lot of tensions with their operations program.",0.0
False,,"We only have a few years down the road though, and there are a few issues that are emerging that we just wanted to call to your attention. The first is what it means for the state these days to approve a project. So for example, last year's issues in many projects, you effectively approved them. CSU turned around and said, well, I don't have enough money in my budget to fund all those projects.",0.0
False,,"And so, funded a subset of them. This year, they're coming before you resubmitting some projects they didn't fund with some new projects, submitting more than they think they realistically can fund this year.",0.0
False,,"So it's calling into question, what does it mean for the state to approve a project? Does it mean it will be funded that year, a few years from now or never, depending on if the segment's priority has changed. The other big issue is this Governor doesn't want to have another state GO bond,",0.0
False,,"but the Legislature in some cases has expressed interest it does and a future Governor might and what would happen if there was another state bond? At that time, we would have to consider from both the state and the segment's perspective. It'll be very awkward to figure out how to fund the new bond.",0.0
False,,"Should it be outside of their main item, inside their main item? Should we re-calibrate their main item to take out what we put in and pull it back out? The final issue on, I think the governor's idea, again was that if the money's pulled together, the segments again will manage and maintain their properties wisely, but",0.0
False,,"it's still a bit of a concern about who is responsible for maintenance, because even this Governor has funded some maintenance for the universities outside of the main item and both segments are requesting more money to fund maintenance outside their main item. In addition to this, we're in the well-advanced season of an economic expansion.",0.0
False,,"Most main stream economists think we'll go another few years. So in this kind of environment, we would have hoped that given the size of the maintenance backlogs, they'd be gone by now.

Because there's some concern that, sometimes, and I've even listened patiently to discussions we've had here relative to people's health care needs, and residential needs, and other needs as they move into the community. I handed out earlier a chart, that is a page right out of the Department of Developmental Services fact book. And what I'd like you to encourage you to do is to look carefully at the numbers and the populations that are described here. For example, I'll just pull one out here in the lower left corner there's 397 people with profound levels of intellectual disability in the state developmental centers. Today there are 8,400 of those people living in the community. Likewise if you look in the lower right corner where you look at people who have three or more special conditions or behaviors, there's 250 in the developmental centers.",0.0

So I think our point in raising that is to remind you and others that as we look at this overall system we don't look at it as a bifurcated system. We look at it as a pot of funds serving this population and that as we look towards closing the developmental centers we learn some lessons from the past that we don't do necessarily what we did when we closed Stockton, and Camarillo, and Agnews, and Lanterman. There is a discussion of transfer trauma for example in the movement of people. We closed Camarillo in one year in order to move the property over to CSU to develop CSU Channel Islands.",0.0
False,,"All the population in that place were moved and they were moved to other facilities, mostly state facilities in that case. But some were moved into the community and we did it very successfully. By moving people of the community, we gained in the state because we'll recapture federal funds, which we are not doing in the units that you correctly have noted have been decertified. The other thing is that we would ask that the funds that as these developmental centers close and as those assets remain, that those be used to fund people in the community, including those in the developmental centers, but also the remaining community. We've had a nice 10 year run prior to last year's increase of no rate increases for the community while we continue to support the developmental centers at a rising cost per person because of the overall plant costs and costs there. So our point there is that these funds do need to follow people into the community, but they need to follow everybody in the community and that we don't lose the asset and the operating dollars permanently.",0.0
False,,"I think overall, just a reminder everybody in the developmental centers today is like the people in the community in that they all have an IPP in place. Just like people in the community, through the Regional Center, you are supposed to have an IPP. An individualized plan that is your plan for what you want to happen in your life to make it as fulfilling and as interesting as possible. Nobody's different in that regard. We have the same disabilities as we've noted on paper. So overall I think the Lanterman Coalition's concern is that we not just close these down. Spend every dollar possible transitioning people into the community and then leave nothing at the end of that for the community. We see that as an asset that can be used to continue to serve people under the Lanterman Act in California including those in the community. Thank you for your time.",0.0

One thing I would urge there that I think our system hasn't done a really good job of doing overall.

I think we often aren't reaching out enough to the people who are asking to put our people to work and I think we just have to go out of our way either through policy or through actual practice of getting groups like CalChamber, CalRestaurant Association, Grocers to come to the table and talk to us about employment and tell us what they need to make it work for them.",0.0

But if a plan does not have the internal capability of performing those functions, they will sometimes go out and contract with a pharmacy benefit manager. And the reason that health plans value that relation is that in those cases, they use a PBM to drive down the costs of drugs, particularly when faced with manufactures that have patent protections on their products.",0.0

But every one of these will have some kind of public process in their localities to be able to setup those guidelines and I don't think, let you speak more about it, but there's any evidence that these turns into just, these are generally attached to some kind of treatment facility.

So in my experience with working with people who are using, when they initially use, I think that's the concern that you're talking about, when people kind of nod out for a little while. Heroin addicts will refer to using as getting well.

This wouldn't necessarily be an additional issue of liability above and beyond that and once programs are authorized under this legislation, it provides some protection for the participants and the program operators to address some of that issue. What we do know from the experience in other places such as in Vancouver, what happened in Vancouver was the regional health department covered the liability insurance for the program and just incorporated that into their liability coverage for all of their health facilities and so it was a small additional piece given that they're already covering healthcare facilities that have these issues.",0.0

False,,"to move away from enhancements, and trying to work within a system where reentry rehabilitation starts to work. Keeping people in longer and longer and longer.

False,,"It was difficult, it was painful. And the solutions that were foisted on us through legal actions were costly. And it resulted in us coming up with a solution to send people to the county level. When I came in as chair of budget sub five, I worked to get more money down to the sheriffs so",0.0
False,,"that they could build more county rehabilitation reentry centers. because we firmly believe that that will relieve some of the overcrowding. In addition, we're working on bail, which will hopefully relieve the overcrowding. And there's things working right now to help county jails.",0.0

False,,"What this bill kind of says, and I know you're going to take the politics out of it. But unfortunately, we have someone in Washington who became who he is, by saying, by using race and religion, Mexicans and Muslims, at being a problem to this country.

So this is one of my favorite topics to talk about, two of them combined together. Trying to increase food security and decrease things going into the waste stream. This bill simply clarifies and creates the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, that clarifies what kind of foods can be donated and if they're past their due date, we clearly know one in eight Californians are still hungry.",0.0
False,,"One in four children are hungry. And retailers and manufacturers and restaurants are still telling us that they throw away about 40% of their food that they could possibly donate because of the fear of liability, so this clarifies a lot of that issues.

But to use a number, 15 in this case, I'm very concerned about that. We have to protect the litigants' constitutional rights to due process and that includes a hearing. There can be a pre-filing order issued, but that's after a hearing. And that's already in place. It's a protection that's already in place.

False,,"Again, also with my cursory review of the LOA's report, want to thank them for putting forward the suggestion.

False,,"Our issue with this bill isn't whether public authorities have some role in mergers and acquisitions. Indeed, they already have a role. In fact, in approving recent transactions, the DMHC has required extensive undertakings on the parties involved, including my member health plans.",0.0
False,,"Our opposition then is based primarily on the vast scope of the bill and what we view as a vague and broad standards that plans and regulators would have to meet in order to obtain prior approval from a state regulator for transactions. As currently drafted, Assembly Bill 595 discourages reasonable new investments in health care that are intended to create efficiencies in economies of scale.",0.0
False,,"From our read of the bill, even a relatively basic consolidation or transfer of assets within the same corporate family could trigger prior approval from state regulators and hold back innovative investments. We believe that this is an intensive amount of work for relatively little value. AB 595 also institutes unreasonably high hurdles for mergers and acquisitions.",0.0
False,,"As only one example, the measure expressly requires that regulators find in fact, that a merger proposal itself will lower prices before the merger or acquisition can be approved. Which consumer prices? Prices that doctors charge health plans, prices that hospital systems charge health plans, prices that drug companies charge health plans, or are we talking about premiums?",0.0
False,,"If we're talking about premiums or other prices, the language fails to take into account the reality of the health care market. It fails to take into account potential increases in utilization, provider rates, government mandates, rising drug costs. All of these things together impact consumer prices in a short and long-term.",0.0
False,,"So we believe that codifying unreasonable standards will make conditional approvals under this bill inevitable, thus placing the plans that are contracted provider groups and consumers and limbo. And actually, the conditional approval provisions in this bill are treated in a somewhat interesting way in one section of the bill. The regulator must take, make a series of findings that, again, from our perspective, we view as unrealistic in order to approve or conditionally approve a transaction.",0.0
False,,"And in another section of the bill, conditional approvals are only allowed if the parties of the transaction agreed to prevent, not mitigate, but prevent things from happening that may or may not happen. So we have a question of how that sequence would unfold. Okay, my time's almost up.",0.0
False,,"I just want to say that we appreciate the author's amendments which resolve one issue, but again, the bill applies to vast, vast majority of the market.

False,,"Some of those mergers were blessed by public authorities, other mergers were not. So I bring that up because we do have a process in place that allows some to go forward and some not to go forward.

False,,"Thank you for that question, Assemblymember. Obviously, the amendments that were offered yesterday are being reviewed by our membership. As of today, we're straight opposed to the bill. I think you have to pass the test first of whether we think action is required in this area.",0.0
False,,"And we would argue that number one, the DMHC already has authority in this area. When a plan wants to merge, consolidate, etc, it's considered the material modification of their license. So the Department of Managed Health Care already has authority in this area as a modification to the license to review and take action in this area.",0.0
False,,"Number two, federal authorities sometimes get involved in these actions. The Department of Justice has weighed in on a couple of mergers, and those are on hold right now. So at this time, we fail to see what further action is required in this area especially considering since California has a relatively healthy and competitive market.",0.0

False,,"They are as so much else in technology is, far faster, smaller and better than the technology that has preceded, the infrastructure that has preceded them, but for California to maintain it's position as the high tech leader of the nation, it is critically important that policy makers take action to remove unnecessarily obstruct barriers to innovation investment while balancing municipal interest, we believe 649 does that, and in finding that balance, we ask that you consider the compelling public benefit Californians will receive from 5G, including improved public safety services, like next-generation 911, immersive education, traffic management systems, tele-medicine, just to name a few.",0.0
False,,"We're also complete a comprehensive poll on the issue, and the data has been very clear that most Californian's agree the vast majority want 5G, believe it is important to invest in 5G and support streamlining the process to improve wireless communications.

Through smart community solutions, lowered energy use, reduced traffic congestion, and fuel cost and improved public safety.",0.0
False,,"Specific to California communities, the economic benefits of 5G over the next several years will, in large cities like LA, create nearly 37,000 jobs and an increase GDP of approximately 6 billion, but it doesn't only apply to large cities. It will also benefit small and rural areas of the state for example the economic benefit to Sonoma County is projected be more than 4,600 jobs and GDP increase of $765 million.",0.0
False,,"The stunning gains of 5G technology will be headed a fraction of the public cost to previous infrastructure investments. Unlike other infrastructure projects like the interstate highway system and others, this one will cost taxpayers next to nothing and will be almost completely paid for by private investment.

I think to take a step back from what's been said so far we of course would associate all of our comments, the comments that have been made by Sirus.",0.0
False,,"Does that mean we can only require a building permit and not an encroachment permit when maybe both are needed. There are just there is a lot of ambiguity in the language.

There are multiple, multiple rescue groups that are very specific",0.0

False,,So thank you very much.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, so the contract explicitly says in the case of default that the lending company will repossess the animal.

And so, the value actually declines during that period of time.",0.0
False,,"And so, the ability to resell that animal is very, very limited at that point and obviously the lending company, again, is not in the position to take care of and be responsible for an animal. That's just not their business practice, obviously. And so the alternatives for them in the market are pretty limited, unless they want to start their own kennel, so.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, if you don't mind.",0.0
False,,"From our perspective, the rationale for prohibiting it altogether is that it's wholly unnecessary. There are alternatives in the market and this particular alternative, it's predatory in nature, it really preys upon a certain demographic. It is anti-consumer protection.

We believe that high quality professional development will yield an increased number of bilingual teachers in a Shorter period compared to the four, five years of a traditional teacher preparation program.",0.0

That leadership has provided billions of dollars of investment into California and over 12,00 direct jobs from that EV production.

False,,"That have missions far broader than the operation of the school. It wouldn't be appropriate to apply open meeting laws to the entire foundation, so we target those provisions only at board meetings that involve the school. Also, 806 applies to charter schools, the elements of the California Corporation Code.",0.0
False,,"Provisions that prohibit conflict of interest and adds more. It would require charter board members to recuse themselves from any vote affecting their own financial interest.

And I'm going to speak a little bit about that, but my colleague here, Marcia Aaron from KIPP LA will also speak to it, because she has personal experience with it. But the important thing about government code 1090 is that it bans absolutely a charter school board member, and some executive staff,",0.0

So if you have a board member who has taken out a second mortgage on his home, and to help keep the doors open, under government code 1090, that board member would be prohibitive from doing that. Or would not be able to serve on the board, or if he did, it would go to jail.",0.0
False,,"A board member who has a facility that he could lease to the school for a dollar a year, would be prohibited under government code 1090 from doing that. Those are the kinds of people that we want to have on our boards of directors. Many of you have sat on nonprofit boards of directors.",0.0

False,,I do want to raise one additional point because a question has been raised that I want to make sure is answered. There is language in the bill that occupies the field of conflict of interest language. In the print version it also occupies the field of open meetings and Public Records Act. In an agreement with the Chair last night we have decided to limit that occupy the field language to just conflict of interest.,0.0
False,,"That means that the authority for a school district to impose additional requirements on open meeting or public records will be restored to the school district in the context of the amendments that Senator Glazer has just accepted. So it is broadening transparency back to where it was under current law, rather than restricting it on the open meetings and public records. And I will close with that and be available for any questions when appropriate.",0.0

False,,"And this bill seeks to peel away the few protections we have, even in the face of a steady stream of waste, fraud, and abuse in the charter school environment. The sponsors of the bill suggested some kind of deal with CTA and that, there is some kind of agreement with three our of four of the transparency accountability provisions that apply at charter schools.",0.0

False,,"We did distribute a opinion by Legislative Council that opines, not only these three laws already apply at charter schools, but so does government code 1090. The government code 1090 subjects governing board members to criminal prosecution for self dealing in efforts to protect tax dollars. It makes clear that no member of the governing board may have a financial interest in the decisions before the board.",0.0
False,,The sponsor and the author are suggesting that the conflict of interest provisions within the corporations code are sufficient. But the corporations code allows half of the governing board to be making a profit from the contracts that they're approving. This is because the corporations code protects the corporation. While government code 1090 protects the public and protects our tax dollars.,0.0

False,,"And over the next few years, she revised the terms of the lease, increasing the rent that her school paid to her company. Stephanie Mcfarland was perhaps listening to the sponsors of the bill when she hosted a staff party with tax dollars meant for California classrooms. And when I say staff party, I'm talking about Hollywood. I'm talking about casinos. I'm talking about limousines. I'm talking about an open bar. We're also very concerned.",0.0
False,,"I mean I heard the author say that there's been a highlight here and there. This is a case that occurred literally three weeks ago. There's been a pattern that's outlined in a report that I passed out earlier to the Members of the Committee that documents $81 million of waste, fraud, and abuse of tax dollars in the California public charter school environment alone.",0.0
False,,"We're also very concerned about the portion of the bill that's intended to create confusion, about what kind of relationship a for-profit corporation can have with a charter school. For example, the bill suggests that a for-profit corporation cannot hire half of the teachers. Can they hire the principle?",0.0
False,,Can McDonald's hire a McDonald's employee to be the principle of the school and then paint the gigantic McDonald's mural on the school and have McDonald's for lunch everyday?

And I'm quoting now, starting at charter school requires the strong commitment of dedicated individuals willing to serve on a governing board.",0.0
False,,"And it went on to explain why he was vetoing those other efforts that go along the lines of I know that you desire.

And on the conflict of interest, we try to be more specific and clear about ways in which board members have to conduct themselves, recusal.",0.0

We create remedies for the authorizer better than what exists today, in terms of going after boards that don't act properly, as it does happen.

False,,"at least the Brown Act, Public Records, and Political Reform Act. But what we want to see in the law. Is it clarified, in statute, that these things apply once and for all. So we don't ever have a question again, between Mister Bramble and myself, about what applies.",0.0
False,,"So regarding that question, Dr. Pan, I hear that the Charter Schools Association recommends their folks follow some of these laws. At the same time, they also say you don't have to follow these laws, which is extremely problematic. I would go so far as to say, about 90% of the legal community would say very clearly. That what the law says, in current form, is that charter schools, in their waiver,",0.0
False,,"have a waiver from the laws that uniquely apply to school districts. That's that big blue book, the Education Code. These laws we're talking about is not in the education code. This is Government Code 1090, the Open Meetings,",0.0
False,,"Open Records, and Political Reform Act are not part of their waiver. And so, the Legislative Council, for example, we've asked over a series of years, what their opinion is on the matter to make it clear. And they've made it very clear, that all four of these laws do currently apply. We've been running a bill to try and just clarify that.",0.0
False,,"Because we feel like there's been a lot of cases, where the confusion about whether they need to follow these laws has resulted in serious cases of waste, fraud, and abuse of tax dollars.",0.0
False,,"And there has been, in alignment with Legislative Council opinion. The FPPC that does the work of enforcing the Political Reform Act has been asked this question, on a couple of occasions. And it has written letters that I can provide to you, opining that, again, charter schools must comply with the Political Reform Act. It's very much in alignment with Legislative Council's opinion.",0.0
False,,"Let us say, Senator Pan, we agree, and I think Mr. Bramble would agree with me. That we agree that the Brown Act, the Political Reform Act, and the Public Records Act should apply to charter schools. Or, should be in the statute applying to charter schools. I think where the difference is, and he can speak for himself.",0.0
False,,"There are a couple of things that we have added to the bill, that are relatively modest. And I can tell you what those are, if you want to understand how modest they are, that reflect the specific needs of a charter school. For example, under the Brown Act, you currently cannot meet with a teleconferencing capability, if you happen to be in a remote location.",0.0
False,,"What we want to provide, especially for those networks that operate in multiple counties. Is to make sure that there is real-time teleconferencing availability, for parents in the county in which the board is not meeting. So we want to make things more transparent with that provision, make sure that more parents are engaged in the process. And unfortunately, CTA objects to that, thinking that is not appropriate.",0.0
False,,"And I would agree there, that we object to that in a big way. There's no replacement for sitting in a room with folks in your community, to have this kind of open meeting. The idea that somebody, if they want to run a school in LA, and they want to run a school in San Francisco, should be able to have some kind of virtual governing board meeting is inappropriate. If you want to run a school in LA, you have a meeting in LA, where the community can get to it.",0.0
False,,"And if you want to run one in San Francisco, and you take that on to do those two locations? Then you need to have a governing board meeting in each of those locations. I think that in all three of these cases, the Charter School Association is asking for carve-out. So, just briefly on the other two.",0.0
False,,"And I understand there may be some agreement that's occurred around the Public Records Act that I'm not familiar with, so I need to get up to speed on whatever that agreement was. But in terms of the Political Reform Act, my understanding was the Association was looking to not allow someone to have their charter school revoked simply because someone refused.",0.0
False,,"Or didn't, for whatever reason, declare they had a financial interest in something that was occurring before the governing board. The idea being that, you can't be revoked for breaking the law about potential conflicts of interest? That's moving away from transparency. Just as not having a governing board meeting in the community where you are locating the school is moving away from transparency and accountability to that community. It's not a step forward, it's a huge step backwards.",0.0
False,,"I mean, we would like to clarify current law. We would like to make it clear, these are the laws that you need to follow. Any step moving away from transparency and accountability is not something we would support in a charter school environment.",0.0
False,,"And Dr. Pan? There are only, after the amendments that Senator Glazer took, there are only two tweaks left. I mean, one is the one I described. We think that expands transparency to have parents anywhere",0.0
False,,"Where in the state be able to participate, in real time, with a board of directors meeting, that's number one. The second one is what we have in the bill, and this was supported in earlier versions of the bill by the CTA. That you cannot revoke a charter school solely on the basis of a single board member failing to file their Form 700. That would be like kicking you out of the Legislature for failing to file your forms 100.",0.0
False,,"So all we're saying is don't revoke us on that. But that is the only tweak to the political reform act. And with the amendments taken, there are no tweaks to the Public Records Act. So we agree on all three of those laws. We would like to see those two tweaks in addition. And it that's objectionable to the CTA. At this point I don't know what to say.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members for thoughtful conversation. None of us wanted to be Groundhog Day again, where we just keep repeating the same fight to no resolution. And I think as the Chair has indicated, this does provide a lot more clarity in areas of which members feel are important, open meetings, public records, conflict of interest. On the for profit issue, I'm sensitive the Senator from Stockton on that, and we certainly had some testimony.",0.0
False,,"And I'd be willing to change, we had a closure date, as I indicated in my opening, of was it July of, what was the date?  Yeah, I would be comfortable changing that to the time for renewal Which for many for profits would extend to their five year renewal period which, I don't know if that goes 2021 or 2022 in some cases. Which I think would provide a little more comfort for those for-profits that are concerned about this change.",0.0

I think we are trying to provide some progress and I think that moving the bill forward today will help do that. And hope to, I think get 90% of the way there, to where I think we want to be.

False,,You want to start?,0.0
False,,"Instead, what we'd like to remind you is that your locally elected school board members routinely evaluate data, research, and statistics to inform their decisions. There's really nothing unique about the issue before you in that respect. The Local Control Accountability Plan, which was approved by this Legislature,",0.0
False,,"formalized the process by which governing boards assess the needs of their students, set goals, and select among a broad range of interventions, those that best fit the needs of their students. There's nothing unique about school start time that merits taking the decision, this decision out of the hands of those who know the student in particular in this particular community best.",0.0
False,,"Many California schools districts as have been mentioned have considered adopting later start times and after doing their due diligence and gathering input from students, parents, and employees, most of these decided that later start times were not a good fit for them. As has been mentioned, some take some initial steps to move to later start times,",0.0
False,,"encounter some difficulty, and find a need to reverse course. This bill would take that option away from them. Later start times, excuse me, the list of reasons that districts might opt not to do this is too long to get into so I'll refer you to the letters that I've submitted,",0.0
False,,"but typically student safety is the single top concern. The reason for that is that later start times leave most working parents unable to take their children to school. It leaves parents with two choices. One, you, under this bill, would leave children as young as 11 years old responsible for",0.0
False,,"getting themselves to school because secondary school, we're talking all the way down to sixth grade, we have more middle schools than junior highs in California. Option number two is dropping off your child at school at the time that you can drop them off, which is the time you're dropping them off now, when there my not be anyone there to supervise them. Both of those options present a safety concern for children.",0.0
False,,"I remind you that we are living in the era of school choice, as you are well aware from some of the previous bills. And not all children attend a neighborhood school that's within a short walking distance. And I will also remind you that people transportation resources are very much lacking in this state, so most school districts have to prioritize busing for students in in special education programs.",0.0
False,,"The only way to mitigate the impact of such a sweeping mandate and keeping kids safe for this bill to become law would be for the Legislature to provide funding for near universal before school programming. And we note that the current before and after school programming, the funding is limited as it stands under the current demand. But of course, that would mean that the children who stand to gain the most potentially from later start times",0.0
False,,"would actually end up starting their day at roughly the same time that they're starting now. I can address the proposed amendments of detail, if that's the will of the chair, but suffice it to say that they don't address our concerns. Additional start time to, excuse me, additional time to implement the bill won't",0.0
False,,"make any difference if the real world conditions that conflict with the mandate still exist in the future. Namely that parents still won't have the ability to dictate to their employers what time they're going to start their work day. The loss of one period in the school day would still be a problem for, for example, a high-achieving high school student who is trying to get in as many advanced placement classes as possible.",0.0
False,,"That still puts them at a disadvantage for competing for admission to selective colleges and universities, so even though the amendments say that the bill is silent on what is now being rebranded as zero period that's what used to be first period. So we're still pushing and we're still losing that first period of the day in the morning. We are limited as to how late we can push the end time for",0.0
False,,"all of the reasons you're aware of for other things that children need to be doing, including being home with their families, and eating dinner, and going to sleep. To recap, the research recommending later start times is certainly strong enough to warrant individual governing boards to consider it. But, studies of small groups of school districts in states far less diverse than California do not warrant the risky experiment that SB 328 asks you to undertake.",0.0
