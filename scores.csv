False,,"We're here today, backing up the letter of support we filed in support of Mr. Doyle.  We think he's a fine guy for this job. I do want to make a couple comments though, related to some of the issues that we would ask you to keep a close watch on as this moves forward.",0.0
False,,"And it also, as the next appointment comes up, which is for the director's position. There's a few things going on right now, that are quite relevant to what's going to happen with this population and we absolutely look forward working to Mr. Doyle.",0.0
False,,They're looking forward to working with Mr. Doyle on these issues.  The federal government's come down recently with some massive changes proposed to the CMS guidelines that guide the funding relationship we have with the federal government for this population.,0.0
False,,"A lot of the direction they're seeking promotes independence in a model where people should be living as independently as they can out of the community among us.  That's absolutely the right spirit that we are all, you know, should be heading in the direction of.",0.0
False,,"However, some of the speed with which they want to move, could threaten a lot of people out in the community, in your districts, today and their family members who have certain arrangements set up and programs that they work with the individuals in the agencies in their community and, you know, literally if the federal government were allowed to move forward and some of the guidelines that with literally throw people out of existing programs because it wouldn't be funded anymore under federal funding.",0.0
False,,"And, we've got to keep a careful watch on that.  I think we're also at a point in time, where everybody would agree that the system has been, at least in the community which serves 270,000 Californians and their families every day, we are at a point of chronic underfunding.",0.0
False,,"And, we're looking for more from the department than just simply doing their job and following along in the budget process.  We are looking for leadership, we're looking for proposals to this body that will help fix these situations, and we ask that there be careful contemplation of policies like, for example, removing exclusions from over time or ...",0.0

I can't imagine living every day in the place where I was abused, with perpetrators or people who investigated these crimes being allowed to walk freely among there.",0.0
False,,"And, that wouldn't happen in the community.  In the community, people would be arrested, they would be prosecuted, programs to be closed.",0.0
False,,"The last thing on the developmental centers, it is a great idea to look at other uses.  We would ask the department and Mr. Doyle to look very carefully at the proposition of the $500,000,000 that we spend in the operations of developmental centers today and, probably, the $700,000,000 in property that we have today and look at some transfer of those assets into the community to address those problems that were raised earlier.",0.0
False,,We like Mr. Doyle  a great deal.  He has a great background for this with Department of Finance.  We've worked with him there.  We trust him to be a good person in this regard and we urge your confirmation. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Jennifer Kuhn, Leg. Analyst. So, when the state started implementing the LCFF, that base year, it was 72% of funded. It had more generous targets and it knew that it would take a number of years to get up to those targets. Under the governor's budget we've estimated for 2015/2016, so just a few years later the state would be 85% funded. So it made considerable progress. It would be slightly ahead of schedule in that regard. Having said that though, because the targets are COLAed, you have to have growth in the guarantee that's quite a bit faster than COLA to make a serious dent in to getting there. Under our 5 year forecast, we have the last year of the period at about 90 some percent funded. So, still it would take again a number of years. Although we appear to be on track, it really depends on what happens to the guarantee moving forward. It's very straightforward to calculate. If we were at the full rates today, it would cost the state $57 billion and $9 billion of it would be associated with supplemental concentration funding for English learners and low-income students.",0.0
False,,"It's not quite as easy to say exactly how much that we're giving out can be associated with those students because it's really based on what they were given, and a closing of the gap, but what we do know by design how much they're supposed to get and some day we'll know exactly how much they're getting. In the end term we are really relying on these plans to have districts described to us what they're doing. So at a minimum we can at least know what they're telling us they are doing.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Madame Chair. As many of you know, I've been a big advocate of the courts and fought like heck to ensure that the trial court's get as much funding. Hopefully, you have seen the recent audit by the state auditor, which was very enlightening and unbelievably disturbing in a lot of ways. I might be one that on this panel that may be looking at doing things another way, at cutting the court budget because of some of the problems that we see in that while trial court rooms are being closed all across this state for lack of funds. We're paying about 8 managers $179,000, more than your boss the governor, more than the general manager department of general services who manages thousands of employees, which is about 800 employees, averaging about $28,000 than anybody else at that same level.",0.0
False,,"In addition, they're maintaining the fleet about 66 cars. 7.2 million employees are part time and could have been done by the trial courts, but they're being charged for that. There is about $30 million in questionable court spending and salaries. The audit points out about $186 million that could go directly to trial courts, which everyone who was here the last two years on the budget, that I've been here, that was the number one priority: getting money to the trial court. It looks like there's hundreds of millions not getting to them because AOC and judicial council. I was the director of real estate. We're leasing space in San Francisco, instead of here in Sacramento.",0.0
False,,"People aren't together with their managers and with their employees. I'll do it for free. I used to be Director of Real Estate. I will get that done pretty quick. So, this kind of Marie Antoinette feeling ""let them eat cake"", I know it is only 4.2% of the budget, but those individuals make 100% of the decisions on the budget. I just want to know if the governor has any -  I know that the audit came out about the same time as the budget coming out, but he does he have any feelings on what we can do? Should we start by cutting it by $93 million until they can prove that they can come up with a over $186 million worth of savings and efficiencies because I'm trying to get a quarter-of-a-billion back to the trial courts, which we can do if everyone's cooperative on the judicial council and AOC side.",0.0
False,,"Thank you.  My name's Will Barrett.  I'm a senior policy analyst for the American Lung Association of California.  I'm also speaking today for the Coalition for Clean Air and the 70 organizations that make-up the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition, or CVAQC.",0.0
False,,"We're all in strong support of Dr. Capitman's appointment to the governing board today and urge you to move this forward.  As you heard, Dr. Capitman  is committed to building coalitions in leadership for community health in the San Joaquin Valley and to really highlighting the air pollution burdens on valley children, seniors, and disadvantaged communities through his research and educational efforts.",0.0
False,,"Since his appointment to the board, he's already demonstrated his commitment to disadvantage communities by meeting regularly with community members to hear concerns, formulate solutions, and to bring a high-level of analysis of the community impacts to the board decisions.",0.0
False,,"Given the severe nature of air pollution challenges facing valley residents, Dr. Capitman's experience, expertise, and dedication are vital to leading the value to a prosperous and cleaner future.  So, we urge you to support this nomination and thank you Dr. Capitman for your service. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Jennifer Kuhn Leg Analyst, our understanding is that the U.C.  budget has become quite interesting, because on the one hand the Governor is expressing concern about their costs; about the cost per degree, there part cost per completion that cost per student. At the same time providing some money for the cost to go up without enrollment growth. So, it's just an  even higher spending per degree, higher spending per student.",0.0
False,,"So, I think this is just trying to foster a conversation; let's be comfortable as a state, as a University that whatever costs are generated are important enough that folks are willing to share in the funding of them. And again, it's just within this broader context of if there is a concern with costs at U.C.'s let's sort of try to address it coherently as opposed to in pieces.",0.0

False,,"I don't think any CBO would tell you that their LCAP in the first-year was perfect. I've seen some things myself that have made me slap my forehead, and, but I think that they want to get better. And I think that our organization wants to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem.",0.0

False,,"Good afternoon, Steve Cruz on behalf of The California Building Industry, so first I want to start with the thank you for the bond is critical to the housing and development so your work and craft of the bond, and delivery, I think it was a hundred eighteen votes in support was very impressive, so now as you move to implementation I would echo comments made about today about moving officially and deliberately of course through the process as you know for housing development. We have to plan a twenty-year horizon as a result of the show me the water laws, so projects that are before local councils and local governments today have to demonstrate dedicated funding source for those projects twenty years out so the faster that you move, the faster that less projects are threatened at the local level and they're all important us.",0.0
False,,"Senator Nielsen mentioned surface storage, that's certainly critical for ground water storage, but recycle water, conservation, home builders have come a long way in making homes more efficient so that's an important component to it, desalination, all those things are very important, the last thing I would say, sort of guard against, you know, rewriting the bond in ways that aren't consistent with the will of that the legislature, the voters, and I think that's important, and really want to continue to work with this committee, and would love an opportunity to come at a later date if you think that's important to have a further input, so thank you again.",0.0

That's where we are today. We need leadership.",0.0
False,,"We need a different solution, a paradigm shift in thinking. We're hopeful that this gentleman will be allowed to explore that, but if not, we absolutely need the legislature to bring the heat to make that happen. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.",0.0
False,,"AHF is the largest medical care provider, private provider, in the world for people with HIV and AIDS, about 380,000 patients worldwide, 16,000 patients here in our home state of California. This is a huge issue. We appreciate the Governor and the department recognize the importance of it and carving out a certain amount of money to help close the gap.",0.0
False,,"The problem though, is not making sure that we have the money. The problem is making sure that drug prices are fair and rational and work well within the construct of our state budget. We need to make changes in how we fund drug prices, not putting in 300 million dollars for this and 300 million dollars for that. Mr. Chiu, we appreciate your taking a leadership role.",0.0
False,,"For those who don't know, Mr. Chiu has introduced a bill, I think as of today, that begins the process of trying to get the drug prices under control. The last thing I'd like to point out is, this is not just a hep C issue. While hep C is important to AHF because it's often a comorbidity of people with HIV, anti-retro-virals for people with HIV have been a huge problem in terms of pricing, for more than a decade.",0.0
False,,"And we've been trying to get those prices under control. The department has work to do that as well. We've had some success, but not nearly as much success as we need to get this whole issue under control. We encourage the legislature to really aggressively take on this issue from a policy standpoint as much as from a budget standpoint. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and members, Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We're very interested in this 300 million dollar set-aside for one hepatitis C therapy, which there's no dispute. The importance of these new therapies on medical treatment.",0.0
False,,"And, we're also very interested in the role that  our member health plans can play in the worker process down the line as it's fully developed. So while we're encouraged that the administration is taking this very seriously, it is very worrisome from our perspective that the state even has to set aside this large amount of funding just for one particular drug.",0.0
False,,"Particularly, since the pricing of these drugs is somewhat of a mystery. A few weeks ago, in the Senate Health Committee, the representative for one of the manufactures stated in committee that they do not base their pricing for these drugs on the cost of development, which we find to be very curious.",0.0
False,,"So, from our perspective the 300 million dollar set-aside may not truly reflect on the entire cost to the state as has been discussed. Some of our MediCal managed care plans are still working with the state to receive other supplemental kick payment for hepatitis C drugs.",0.0
False,,"So, again the 300 million dollars may not entirely reflect that, and we have some questions in the department on that issue. Ultimately, we are encouraged that the LAO be taking a second look at this at the time, and they may revise. It might do us good to ask the LAO or some other state entity to take a longer-term, longitudinal approach, I've always wanted to say that word on the mic, with respect to the analysis.",0.0
False,,"It's very important, in 2015 it's expected that about 12 new blockbuster drugs will be entering the market, so how are we going to pay for these in public programs in the commercial market, and that's a huge concern for us. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and Members Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. While we don't have a formal written position on this particular proposal yet, we have supported similar proposals in the past. We do think the underlying value here is coordination and continuity of care in a logical enrollment process that is designed to reflect at least other aspects of the health care system. So, if this item is held open, we hope it's given fair consideration and some reflection, particularly since the department has gone a long way in limiting if you will the proposal, at least in comparison to proposals that have been offered in the past. So we hope that you will fairly consider it as it's held open thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Chairman Quirk, Chairwoman from the state senate. This is a very important hearing. What will happen today hopefully will start the discussion, but more important, start us looking at solutions and how we curb the amount of police abuse that are going on not only in California but in the nation. It is my hope that California becomes the example and the template for how you reduce police violence and brutality.",0.0
False,,"The alarming thing for me has always been as we look at our clock, that every 28 hours, an African-American male is killed by law enforcement. And that is an abysmal statistic that we have in this country.",0.0
False,,"But I also realize, talking to people like Connie Rice in Los Angeles, a civil rights lawyer who for years sued LAPD. In fact, she prides herself as suing, having more lawsuits against LAPD than anybody else.",0.0
False,,But she's now working within the Los Angeles Police Department with Chief Beck to come up with alternatives to how you solve this problem.,0.0

False,,"That we don't have all white male law enforcement agencies in this state or in this country. Because I believe they are the solution for how to stem what's going on, but also doing a paradigm shift in the way we police and the way we interact with the public.",0.0
False,,And so I want to thank Senator Hancock and Assembly Member Quirk for pulling together this committee. I'm looking forward to getting some input.,0.0

One, I want to know what information you would need to be able to produce that for this committee, what kind of resources you would need to implement that within DOJ,",0.0

False,,"But we also need to know, what do you need to do to compile the amount of information you need to give an effective reporting back to us, and how long would that take?",0.0
False,,"Maybe we can talk about this offline, because I don't want... I have people coming to my office that want to legislate it.",0.0
False,,"And if we can do it through the budget process, which would be quicker, faster, much more effective, I would like to do it that way.",0.0
False,,"Otherwise we'll be, you know, six months, eight months down the road through the legislative process and then it's gonna take you another probably year to get funding to get ramped up. Let's get all the way to the funding and ramped up part. You can come to my office, we can sit and I can give you the parameters of what everyone's looking for as far as use of force, and what we ultimately want to find, both on law enforcement side and on the public side.",0.0
False,,"- And thank you for your testimony. My question's just a little bit different. You're an African American male who's within the system that's dealing with your colleagues, your law enforcement officers. And I know there's a code of silence and I know there is this thing where you don't basically rat out another fellow officer.",0.0
False,,"How do you handle it when you know some of your fellow officers aren't behaving appropriately? You know inside of your heart you need to say something, you need to do something to stop that behavior because with one or two of you do something wrong, you're all painted with the same brush.",0.0
False,,"Heaven knows any elected official will tell you that. What that feels like. But how do you handle that, so that this distrust or even the rogue cops, they're doing things that are illegal or brutalizing the community. You know it. You know who they are. How do you personally handle that?",0.0

False,,"Yes, it's good to see you, Sheriff Christianson, and Deputy Sheriff Brown, just need to let you know that the Ceasefire One Program is something that we're gonna look at it budgets of five, I haven't told Assembly Member Lackey yet, but we're looking to hopefully fund it in the CalGRIP program. So I just gave him a heads up.",0.0
False,,"Well, it's the CalGRIP program, so hopefully it trickles down to the appropriate people. Actually my question is for Tingirides because I work with Connie Rice, and she mentioned you. Actually I have three questions. And two of them is just because I wanna verify whether or not it's an urban legend. Plus a lot of these stories don't get out.",0.0
False,,"Especially the good stories with LAPD and I would like for you to repeat it, not only here for us in the committee, but also for everyone in the audience, that when you change the way you police, you get some unintended consequences that could be very very good.",0.0
False,,"And so I just need to verify, one, well it's about Christopher Dornan, and when he went on his crazy rampage against officers, it's my understanding he was going to try to go and kill a former Captain that he used to have, and he was going after them, and the Bounty Hunter Crips gang, which is your natural adversary within the Nickerson Projects, I believe they wanted to help.",0.0

False,,"And then my third question, you need to verify whether or not these stories, or at least give me the straight poop of what really happened. And then the third thing is, Connie talked about funding, Connie Rice, getting it off the ground, ensuring that the officers are there for five years, so that there's some continuity.",0.0
False,,"Looking at the way you do policing in a different way, giving you incentives for doing keeping people off the street, getting kids out of gangs, and that's how you get paid, and that's how you get your ""atta boys"" by doing that more so.",0.0
False,,"But where are you now? As far as, that was five years, you started in 2011, we're here now, will you continue to be funded, do we need to worry about whether or not this program starts to wane after so many years?",0.0

False,,Miss Weber was first.,0.0
False,,"Afternoon, Rosa Aqeel with Pico, California. I just wanted to make a couple observations. First, I think it's really unfortunate that all of the law enforcement officers have left. I think that if those are the good guys, then that's really, really concerning. I would hope that they would wanna hear what the community has to say, especially given that most of the folks that are speaking are folks of color.",0.0

False,,And it builds the chasm that exists already between communities of color and law enforcement. So I think that we have to be really thoughtful about what that's really saying.,0.0
False,,"Because if those really are the good guys and not even the good guys will say that black lives matter, that people of color matter, that there are things that are messed up in existing practices, then how are we ever to trust them?

False,,"This is when I put my budget hat on.

This is your first meeting of budget so far.",0.0

False,,Mr Rodriguez is a veteran too. Did you did you wait to make your opening statements? Okay.,0.0
False,,And I welcome everyone here to our first meeting as we look at the budget.,0.0
False,,"There's several issues and items that we want to obviously look at. Last year I think we did a phenomenal job in looking at recidivism and really really tackling it. Taking the bull by the horn and starting to, taking the CDCR we have corrections and rehabilitation. The r in rehabilitation for a long-time had been small r,  and we made it to a medium-size and are trying to get to a big r again. And with the help of Secretary beard, who has been phenomenal in and, working with us to bring that back into the system. I think we all believe if we do this right, rehabilitation.",0.0
False,,"We can reach almost all of our goals. Whether it's the number of. Reducing the size of a prison which or as a Governor told me ""we should be ashamed of the number of people we incarcerate in California."" and, I agree with him. As a as a society that believes in forgiveness but most important, a society that believes in second chances we need to be better at that.",0.0
False,,"And if individuals who are incarcerated that can fall within those rules we should be able to provide them steps to get there. Unfortunately in a society like this, we will always have to have room for individuals who do not want to participate in this society in a lawful same way.

False,,"So as we start looking through the budget, ways that we can financially promote all of those goals that we talk about every day. I'm hoping that we take that next step to realizing that.

False,,"The fact that we're there, it's just a different. I mean in a lot of ways it's taken us by shock. So, I'm trying to agree that we need to probably come together and try to think of some ways that we can gauge this.

The court ordered population reduction, have you thought about any long-term plan for how we're going to maintain compliance with the with the court order? Or how we could make it go away?

But we can at least begin that conversation and drill down to exactly what you're talking about and start shopping around and see if it's something that we can obviously legislate.",0.0
False,,"But most important, like you said, we begin to show that, it sounds like you want us to self-regulate ourselves and show the three court judge that we're serious about reducing the number. And not only are we serious, we're going to show you in our legislation or in our budget.",0.0

This whole thing about trying to provide long-term population projections or trends, I would like to have something in place when we meet again to talk about this, when we reschedule this, that we can all agree on.

We have to kind of do a complete turnaround on how we deal with this, and I like the fact that sector (inaudible) is the first to say, once we close prison, we truly save money; so I think we're all on the same page we just need to figure out how to get there.",0.0

False,,"But, I would like to get and for the Committee, we spent five-point-one million on this, and is your way. We can kind of get how that money was dispersed and expenditures,   which you spent it on, for example I think the first program may have gotten dogs out of shelters or sickly dogs for free,  and now these dogs are worth about five thousand dollars a piece, so what makes these dogs so much better than the five thousand-dollar dogs or is that all up in training them and just kind of getting the idea of where we're going and how we're proceeding.",0.0

False,,"Jennifer Kuhn from the Legislative Analyst's Office, and we released our higher ed analysis last week. I was gonna speak directly from the report. Thought I'd spend just a minute on some overview topics, but then dive to performance, which the legislature has indicated it would like to embed as part of budget deliberations, and then make some very high level comments on enrollment, operations, facilities, and costs of sharing, very quickly because I know that you'll be talking about these issues in more depth as you move forward.",0.0
False,,"Starting on page 12 of the report, it shows core funding for each of the segments, focused then on both state general fund as well as tuition revenue, so this is figure five on page 12. And just starting at the top you can see that for UC their budget total core funding again, state general fund and student tuition revenue, 6.3 billion.",0.0
False,,"Under the governor's proposal he's increasing it the 140 million, a 2% increase. This is what you've been hearing earlier today. All of the increase is coming from the state. For CSU you can see their total core funding budget of 5.4 billion, the increase level 158 million. It's a 3% increase and again you can see it's all coming from the state general fund.",0.0
False,,"Just moving down to community colleges, their core funding budget. Again, less reliant on student fee revenue, more reliant on local property tax monies. Their core funds budget is 8.7 billion, an increase of 737 million year over year. Of that 737 million, 500 million is for adult education consortia.",0.0
False,,"So it's helping to fund the state's restructured adult education system. If you were to exclude that, although you wouldn't necessarily want to do that, funding adult education is part of what community colleges do. But without that the increase would be 3%.",0.0
False,,"On page 13 there's just a list of budget proposals. That's what you'll be working through systematically in the weeks to come. So talking about, over the last few years the legislature has taken action to develop some performance measures to ask the segments to develop targets and then voiced an interest in using those budget reviews to inform its budget deliberations.",0.0
False,,"If you turn to page 15, it lifts the performance measures that the state has adopted. And what this particular figure shows is current performance in most cases, 2013-14, and the target in here it's just shown for 2017-18. For the sake of time I'm not going to go through every aspect of the table, but I think highlighting just a few things will illustrate a broader point.",0.0
False,,"If you look for example under graduation rates the four year rate for freshman entrances at UC, you can see that they're at 62%, they have a goal of getting to 66% by 2017. You can see for CSU their six year rate that they're at 53%, they have a plan to getting to 55%.",0.0
False,,"So these aren't necessarily their aspirational targets. What the state asked them to do is under the governor's plan, tell us what you plan to do, what you plan to achieve over this period. So as you can see they've planned to achieve some modest improvements in their graduation rates.",0.0
False,,"A key issue for you is, is this enough? Is moving from 53% to 55% between 2013 and 2017 sufficient progress? Going down in the table you can see funding per degree as well as units per degree. Two measures that are often looked at from an efficiency perspective, are students able to get out with fewer excess units?",0.0
False,,"Are they able to get out with less spending per degree? You can see at both UC and CSU from where they are right now to where they plan to be in 2017 increases in funding per degree, and no reduction in units per degree, or in excess units.",0.0
False,,"So again it might be something that you want to consider rather than just having the segments tell you what they plan to do, what is it that you would hope that they would achieve over this period of time, and is this improvement in this graduation rates and sort of lack of improvement in units per degree and funding per degree something that you think is acceptable, or something that you would like to participate in dialogue with the universities to see if you might want to set different targets?",0.0
False,,"Again, working collaboratively with them to figure out what is realistic with the resources at hand. On page 17, the state has, and the community college system has similar performance measures that are better tailored to the community college system. For example they have a completion rate somewhat comparable to a graduation rate.",0.0
False,,"This is for students who indicate they have a serious academic plan. How many of them within six years complete an associate's degree transfer complete enough courses to transfer. You can see it's 48% overall, and that their target is to improve by 1% of this rate. So for example to improve from 48% to 48.5% year over year. Again it's a very similar issue for you. Is this adequate? Or would you hope that these targets might be more ambitious?",0.0
False,,"You can see also on community colleges just turning a few pages in the report to page 20, that their six year completion rates have been slightly declining, even when you take or hear a broader perspective and you look back in time. So turning then from performance to the basic cost components of the universities and the community colleges budgets.",0.0
False,,"Starting with enrollment, there's been lots of conversation already today about enrollment. The governor for UC and CSU takes one approach which is not to have enrollment expectations, and his approach has been, well, I don't really want to do enrollment based budgeting for UC and CSU because this undermines a conversation about quality.",0.0
False,,"But then for community colleges he provides 2% enrollment growth, and he provides some money that's specifically for student support and success. So, we'd encourage you to take more of his approach for community colleges, which is not to have to choose between access and quality, but every year you're really focused on how to balance access and quality, just as he's doing with the community colleges we would recommend you do for UC and CSU.",0.0
False,,"That is, determining how much enrollment growth you want at each system, and then if there are extra endeavors you want to improve, student support, student success, you make targeted investments in those areas.",0.0
False,,"So to help you get your hands around, what is appropriate enrollment growth at each of the segments, we did what we normally do in terms of looking at the high school, public high school graduates, looking at the college age population in California, looking at the segment's admission data and trying to figure out what it tells us.",0.0
False,,"So demographically the college age population is declining between 2015 and 2016 it's going down about 1%. It's steadily declining, projected to over the next five years. So, when you look all the way out to 2020, the college age population 18 to 24 year olds is about 300 thousand individuals fewer than 2015.",0.0
False,,"So then we also looked at their admits and how many students they're turning away, and UC indicates that it's still admitting all eligible students, both freshman and transfers somewhere in the system. CSU indicates that it's not admitting all eligible transfer students.",0.0
False,,"When we look at their admits for freshmen, it does appear that they're still drawing from their master plan eligibility pool. When you look at their transfer students it's a little bit more complicated in that if they're turning away non-local transfer students, we're not sure there's a capacity issue, and that CSU is designed to serve local students.",0.0
False,,"So if the student had applied to their local campus and gotten in, then it's not clear there's a capacity issue. So, we've just been suggesting that you ask CSU for some finer grain details so that you could determine is there an access problem?",0.0
False,,"Is there a campus that's turning away eligible local transfer students and not accepting any non-local transfer students, such that they don't have capacity already existing if they just reorganized how they did their admits.",0.0
False,,"For community colleges, you've talked about this a little. In the current year they got 2% growth. I'm sorry, in the current year they got 2.75% growth. Based on their current enrollment they're coming in at about 2% growth. So, it's unlikely that they'll get all the way to 2.75 percent in the current year in 14-15.",0.0
False,,So it's something that you'll have more data on in May to try to figure out what you want to do both in the current year and the budget year. What happens in the current year will just happen automatically in terms of how much access they were actually able to provide.,0.0
False,,"If it's 2% in the current year it's likely that something like 2% in the budget year would be reasonable. So just some final comments on operations, facilities, and cost of education. If you turn to page 37, you'll see that right now the state is taking very different approaches on how specifically it's funding each of the higher education segments.",0.0
False,,"So you can see in some cases there's very few strings attached. For UC it's giving them 4%. As you've already talked about today this is creating some, I think, confusion and frustration because you're not quite sure what you're getting from the 4%.",0.0
False,,"Have you gotten enrollment growth or haven't you? Have you gotten just mandatory cost increases? Have you gotten retirement increases covered? As the state has traditionally done we continue to suggest you figure out what are your objectives, and then fund those objectives specifically.",0.0
False,,"If it's enrollment growth, if it's a COLA, if it's stat service increases, retirement, that the state, that you're specific about what you'd like. Even when it comes to base increases the governor has different approaches. For community colleges he funds a COLA, for UC, SCU he just provides the 4% not linked to a COLA.",0.0
False,,"So again, my main message here is just thinking about what you want to achieve. Is it purchasing power, holding it constant? Is it paying for retiree healthcare cost increases, pension increases? For that you go ahead and prescribe what you think are state priorities for the segments.",0.0
False,,"If you turn to page 56 and 57, it itemizes UC and CSU's capital outlay requests, and I just wanted to make two points here. One of the benefits of hearing capital outlay requests in the subcommittee, is that you have the unique advantage of being able to make sure your programmatic and your facility decisions are aligned.",0.0
False,,"So if you do fund enrollment growth, then if there are facility requests related to enrollment growth, you're able to consider those in tandem. There are a few UC requests that are driven based on program expansion, enrollment growth, and again you might want to revisit those after you've made some of your other decisions.",0.0
False,,"You might also find given that these lists can be daunting in terms of all the capital projects that come before you, that you might want some priorities. Do you want to fund life safety projects before program expansions? That could help you identify what you want to do within a segment as well as across the segments. And finally after you've made all these decisions, enrollment growth, operations, COLA, retiree healthcare, facilities, legislature often thinks about how it wants to share those costs.",0.0
False,,"If you turn to page, page 63, you can see that even today, even after the tuition increases that occurred during the recession, all three public segments have relatively low fees when you compare them either to their peer institutions or to other community college systems across the state.",0.0
False,,"And if you turn to page 71, you can see what happens in the state's experience with holding fees flat during economic recovery. Economic recovery is when students' families tend to be fairing better. Their families might be receiving COLAs, again doing generally better obviously than during the recession.",0.0
False,,"And you can see the steep increases in fees during recessions when families tend to be fairing worse. This is the state's experience, so what we've been encouraging the state to think about is after you decide what costs are essential that you think the system is required to both maintain access, to maintain quality, you think about who should bear the costs of those.",0.0
False,,"Should it be entirely the state, or should it be shared? Given the state has state and institutional financial aid programs this tends to be a conversation about should non-needy students, those that don't have financial needs by the way that these programs define them, should they bear any of the extra costs?",0.0
False,,"If their family is doing better, if the state is effectively funding a COLA for the system, should their family be asked to pay a portion of those costs that have been deemed essential for the system? So, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.",0.0
False,,"There's two. Riverside, and...",0.0
False,,You know my colleague might help me.,0.0
False,,"Yes, yes. Well, Paul Golaszewski will give you the right answer.",0.0
False,,"Yes, one can view the universities as, in some ways, when you compare them to all other state agencies in a somewhat advantaged position, because when the state general fund drops during a recession, they can raise raise fees, and given that fees are comparatively low across the country, they can raise them and students still are going to line up and consider it a rather good deal to be able to access the education.",0.0
False,,"Such that when the segments were seeing cuts in the state general fund, they were, to some degree, offset with tuition increases. In addition, if they were financially needy students, they were insulated, they weren't paying the fee increase.",0.0
False,,"That was being covered by the state in the form of Cal Grants. During the recession, tuition and Cal Grants more than doubled, so it was more of a distributional impact on those folks who weren't qualifying for aid, were paying the price. From an institution's perspective, they were a bit better off than some other agencies, because they had this alternative revenue to draw on.",0.0
False,,"When we looked at UC, and you put their student... Their state general fund and their student tuition revenue together, and you compare seven eight with '14 '15, it's down, as I recally, 5%. So, it is still down in per student terms.",0.0
False,,"But, we also looked at it somewhat differently, because UC can access some private money, and other sources of support, which they did increasingly during the recession. So, when you take a somewhat different perspective on how much they spent per student, they were spending a little bit more in '14 '15 than in seven eight.",0.0
False,,"It's sort of an indication of the health of the system. They were able to maintain their program, and actually spent a little bit more per student, post recession, than during the pre-recession years.",0.0
False,,"Yes, and we'd be happy to work with you, because when we do our share of cost numbers, we do count Cal Grants, and I think that we do it without double counting, there's clearly a way that it can be done. So, we'd be happy to work with you to make sure you're getting just the slice of information that you want.",0.0

False,,billion dollars is not spent on the CalWORKS program. It's spent on something else. That's partially why we have a big problem in California.,0.0
False,,"Contrary to the myth that, that family that the maximum family aid for family of two is 670, actually only thirty percent of the caseload",0.0

False,,"I think we've made our thoughts on this matter pretty well known over the years, repeatedly. Particularly on the issue of the timing of these notification, so I don't think we have anything to add at this point.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank you for convenience I should speak since I'm probably the problem child to get us all here today and let.me let me just state I didn't get here to have an audit just off a whim. There were some things were very troubling to me when I first got here and I'm very sensitive to the fact that there have been perceived budget cuts of a billion dollars or more to the court since 2008.",0.0
False,,"However, from my perspective being new here after two years, when I first got here I notice that the Legislature to Governor had pumped quite a bit of money into the courts. I've also assisted in the effort and even though the courts may say they are a billion dollars in a hole, or a billion dollars is being taken away from them.",0.0
False,,We can't forget they got five hundred to six hundred million in CCMS (court case management system). They got another hundred-million from the Legislature in 2013 and I might add in 2013 we gave them one hundred million in my district and they closed a court that helped women who were involved in sex trafficking get off the street.,0.0
False,,"They thought that was a priority to close that instead of trying to help young women who are being victimized in my district every day. We gave another two hundred million to 2014. In the report itself, it calls to question another 386 million in questionable spending, 30 million on cars cell phones and today The Governor has asked that we give the courts another 100 million.",0.0
False,,"From my perspective we've given the court 1.316 billion to 1.4 billion and they still reduce staffing, they still cut courts and they are still crying about another 1.7 billion that was redirected from the court construction funds to core operations and state general funds.",0.0
False,,"From my perspective, there's probably close to two billion dollars that have been pushed into the courts so the Real question is - What the hell did you do that money? What did you do to effectively manage the courts in a way that we did not have to close courts, people did not have to travel a hundred or more Miles to get access to justice?",0.0
False,,"So, as I looked at the core structure, as I sat with several members of my Committee and The auditor about what to audit, I wanted a more comprehensive audit. I wanted audit the construction funds to see if they're being managed properly because billions of dollars that may not be managed properly.",0.0
False,,"What I found is right now is right now The Judicial Court has what I call analysis paralysis. They lead by Committee.  You have a revenue and expenditures Subcommittee six trial court PJ's (presiding judges),",0.0

The Judicial Council has 21 voting members including Judiciary, Legislative and State bar participants Another 58 presiding judges and Trial Courts So the real question is - Who is in charge?",0.0
False,,"Like with The Legislature you have to have one person in charge whether that's a speaker, The Governor or The President pro tempore, you cannot lead by Committee. So I'm hoping that with new management that is coming in specifically with Martin Racino that as I try to work with the chief jar two years ago that we finally have someone in place who's going to actually make some critical evaluation of the entire department and come up with some constructive ways that we can move forward.",0.0
False,,"I love the thing that we did with the workload allocation funding model (WAFM) but I am still not comfortable that there's any accountability there seems to be relatively no oversight. And, there's no transparently.",0.0

False,,"So I am ecstatic about this audit. I'm happy to hear from the Auditor. I think they've done a remarkable job in the.limited scope that they have, and I'm looking forward to some ways that we can one get accountability, transparency and ultimately that this body can have some type of oversight on how the funds are being moved.",0.0
False,,I understand this whole concept of three branches of government but there's a larger branch of government that hangs over all three branches and that's the people. we manage the people's money and at the end of the day that's tho all three are answering too and we're just vessels for that. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"I have several, but I'll keep it down to a minimum because we have other testimony.",0.0
False,,"I agree with you that we need to work closely with the chief justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, and I apologize for another hyphenated last name person, if I put your name. And Martin Hushino. We need to work together with both of them to effect this change because my question is more of, who really is in charge over there at courts.",0.0
False,,"And I'm not blaming them, I'm blaming more the structure. When you go up through the structure, the presiding judges have a lot of authority. As I mentioned earlier with the closure of the David Kenyon Juvenile Justice system and center in my district, after we gave the local courts 26 million, the next day and immediately closed that.",0.0
False,,"And I know you made a comment, it's about a million dollars and all of the different moneys that are paid to high-level employees, but that could have kept that court open. So it's not just a little money, it's not just a little money to a lot of members here who may have smaller courts where that money could have kept their court open.",0.0
False,,"And so I agree with you that we do have a lot of committees in place there, but I used to be an administrator and I've gone through several audits, I even made an auditor cry one time and I know how to get through this, but also know how to wait it out until after the auditors are gone, the elected officials are gone, and we go back to business as usual, and so I'm really trying to come up with the with a way we can help the existing management there right now.",0.0
False,,"Put in place long-term, sustainable accountability measures, transparency measures, maybe it is auditing every once in a while, but my real question is, do you get a sense of if there's anyone truly in charge, I mean you talk about the Strategic Evaluation Committee report and that counsel coming with some brilliance, some excellent recommendations, but somebody's got to implement them, and if you have no one to implement them, no one to do the carrot and stick to ensure that it gets done in a timely manner, it'll never get done.",0.0
False,,"And I think that might be part of the problem, that there's probably an entrenched group of people within the system that are comfortable with status quo, and so if, one, did you ever get a sense that there's anyone who will actually take the bull by the horn and make these things happen, or is it the function of the different committees and things of that nature, very difficult to really drill down and make some significant changes.",0.0
False,,And if there's anything you could suggest to get us there.,0.0
False,,"Let me just say at the outset, Judge Marsha...is it ""slow'?",0.0
False,,"Sometimes I'm John-Sawyer, you know. But both of you have given me some comfort, a lot of comfort as your predecessors before you have come to me on a budget, and a court, Stephen Jarr, and others, gave me a measure of comfort that you two and the Chief Justice really, really want to make some significant changes.",0.0
False,,"And so I would look at us, the auditors office, the joint legislative Audit Committee, my Committee, as partners in this, and I know sometimes it seems a little difficult, but we're all family. Just think of it like a family argument and we're all family trying to move this along to get to a point where we all want to open up more courts and have more people have access to justice.",0.0
False,,"And if we just start focusing in on that, I think we will ultimately get there, and my question is one of those tools that I want to use or possibly use is this tool that we used today, which is the audit. And in some ways, I will agree, probably in a lot of ways, I will agree with Senator Roth about yes, the magnitude of the money may be very small, but for us it might be a microcosm of culture in the court system and that's really what we're getting to right now, today.",0.0
False,,"And hopefully we can work through that. But one of those tools is an audit, and if we worked, for example, and I'll just put that out there, if we were to also try to find some better ways that the local courts are managed, for example, if we were to find a small court, medium-size court, and the LA county court, that probably would be about 40% of the budget.",0.0
False,,"Which I think would be a significant amount of the budget that we could audit and come up with some ideas on how they can manage better, find some savings, and ultimately maybe find some money so that they can open up, or keep courts open.",0.0
False,,"And so in that respect, there's a discussion about whether or not we do annual audits or every 2 years. I'm more inclined to go every 2 years because I think that this one was done after 2 years and I think it was very important get done and we got a lot of great information that we can now use to help formulate a budget, hopefully help you manage your courts better, but how do you feel about the use of audits for you, so that you can better manage your operations, so the two of you can drill down and find things that, because you don't have to staff to go out there and independently look at things, you now have that as a tool for you.",0.0
False,,"So 1 year, 2 years, semi annual audits...Don't give me that audit face.",0.0
False,,"And, just real quick, I've reviewed the audits that have been done internally and they're watching in a lot of ways, and so I recommend you look at them.",0.0
False,,"And I look at audits a little bit differently and we're going to bring this within my Subcommittee, subcommittee five later on, to talk about this.",0.0
False,,"Audis aren't necessarily bad. If the Auditor comes and brings an audit to sub five that basically says you need to increase the budget by X amount, and the functions that this money needs to go is ABC and we get our buckets, that's a much stronger argument for us to legitimately give you money and we have an outside independent Auditor saying that you need money, you need money for these different categories, so I don't necessarily always look at it as a bad thing.",0.0
False,,"In some ways, I look at as a way to validate why you need money, and most important, how much you need, and how quickly you need it, so I wouldn't just get all negative and everything about audits, but this could be a great way to help the judicial system. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"I do want to thank you for allowing us to be on this dice today and most important, just to remind everybody, budget sub five will be looking at the audit and recommendations, and if we can maybe even use some budget language to institutionalize some of this so that we can move forward and ensure that accountability, access to justice, transparency, all those things that have been discussed today, we hopefully will be able to do it through the budget process.

False,,"We don't atempt to amend the bill to include the child exemption, I mean the the parent - the relative exemption that we had in last years bill. That one came out and this is the one piece bill - not a two piece bill okay.",0.0
False,,No absolutely not.,0.0
False,,"Thank you. Good afternoon and Thank you Chairman Beall and Chairman Wieckowski, senator and members of the Committee for having me and for accommodating my lovely ski accident that I'm recovering from.",0.0
False,,"I kind of forgot that I was not twenty and I was fifty eight. So, thank you for having me. I'm Catherine Reheis-Boyd and I represent the Western States Petroleum Association.",0.0
False,,"And our Association for those of you who are not familiar, hopefully you are, but we make-up the state's major oil producers and refineries that",0.0
False,,"are responsible for nearly one hundred percent of all the gasoline, diesel, jet fuel sold in the State of California.",0.0
False,,"So we have I think a unique perspective to bring today and, hopefully, a contribution to make to this discussion.",0.0
False,,And I'm so glad to hear that my friends at the auto industry also have some concerns to express today.,0.0
False,,"Our refiners, I think you know who they are, Chevron, Tesoro, Valero, Shell, Philips 66 and Exxon Mobil.",0.0
False,,They are the focus of many of the state's climate change policies. We certainly are in the stationary source of cap and trade we are in the transportation fuels under the cap and trade,0.0
False,,We're in the low carbon fuel standard. So we are and we have the honor of being in many buckets here in this conversation.,0.0
False,,"But, it's also really important to understand that at the same time we are holding the serious responsibility of supplying adequate reliable fuels to the marketplace.",0.0
False,,And I want to get into that a little bit. It requires us to do that every day 365 days a year.,0.0
False,,"I think, we've talked before about California's transportation fuel market being the third-largest feel market in the world, as a state.",0.0
False,,"And, the only two that are in front of us are the United States of America and China.",0.0
False,,"So, it's a large large market. Your constituents and our customers drive twenty six million cars and over one million medium and heavy-duty trucks.",0.0
False,,That requires thirteen billion gallons of gasoline three-point-five billion gallons of diesel every day.,0.0
False,,"And, that's as we sit here that's two million gallons of fuel every hour of every day.",0.0
False,,We say that just to put this into perspective when we talk about going towards 2020 and post 2020.,0.0
False,,"So the need for reliable transportation fuels in California is enormous and, the benefits for reliable mobility for families and businesses in this discussion is critical.",0.0
False,,"So, a primary concern for our refineries as we evaluate these proposals and these fuel policies is really the potential impact this has on fuels for the state.",0.0
False,,Now we recognize that the state certainly has the most aggressive climate change goals and they intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.,0.0
False,,that is not at debate and we don't question that. But as decision-makers I know you are appreciative of the mobility needs of the public and we have to consider these policies not only in,0.0
False,,their contribution to the state's climate change goals but also to their potential impacts on the fuel supplies.,0.0
False,,Obviously the state has deserved a reputation as a leader when it comes to innovative public policies. But when we look at the rest of the world and where they are going it,0.0
False,,"appears they are heavily relying and this is,a lot of what is being talked on the road Paris, is really policies that are relying on market mechanisms like the cap and trade program.",0.0
False,,That's what everybody's talking about. That's what's going to encourage reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.,0.0
False,,And not conversations on what we call here complementary policies that we think can be confusing costly and potentially contradictory like the low carbon fuel standard.,0.0
False,,I am in a bit of disagreement with my other peers at the table on this topic. Policies like the low carbon fuel standard attempt to set sector specific targets,0.0
False,,that really limit the flexibility to achieve the larger goals that we think not only California's after but the rest of the world is talking about.,0.0
False,,"So, if California wants others to follow its lead we think it's essential to increase the emphasis on the cost-effective marketplace policies rather than policies aimed at specific economic sectors of the economy.",0.0
False,,Now you've talked about today a suite of these regulatory programs that are already in place that are designed to aggressively force development and deployment of alternative fuels and technologies.,0.0
False,,As well as drive fundamental changes in land use. Most of these aggressive policies certainly are in the early stages of implementation.,0.0
False,,"So, there is obviously some uncertainty exists with the fuel supplies whether the manufacturers can actually do it or local governments can comply with it.",0.0
False,,But that being said achieving the necessary emission reductions in the transportation sector to meet the California's climate change goal,0.0
False,,really is focused right now on reducing vehicle travel in sb 375. You've got establishing this the fuel efficiency being talked about in the ARB's Advanced Clean Cars Program.,0.0
False,,The heavy-duty vehicle greenhouse gas regulations. You certainly are taking a very active role in deploying advanced technology vehicles that operate on electricity and hydrogen in the zero emission vehicle program.,0.0
False,,"Which obviously, we've discussed has its challenges but all of us were also there to support AB-8 and getting hydrogen stations being located in the state. Using alternative fuels is very prominent in these regulations.",0.0
False,,"You've got high-level ethanol blend, you've got natural gas from noble natural gas drop-in replacement fuels, renewal gasoline and diesel all of these are very very prominent in all of the existing regulations that we're talking about to achieve all of the goals that we are talking about.",0.0
False,,In addition as you all know as of January one 2015 fuels have been brought under the cap and trade program. And  so CARB's cap and trade program and now they're subject to a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions.,0.0
False,,So this cap is enforceable and it will ensure greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels do not exceed the amount permitted by CARB.,0.0
False,,So of the many policies we have in place today the purpose of meeting the California's climate goals some are intended to reduce the demand for petroleum fuels but others will negatively impact the supply of petroleum fuels.,0.0
False,,We're really making this clarification on focus policies that are on the demand side and not on the ones that can have a negative impacts on the supply-side.,0.0
False,,"So demand side policies we think are the preferred option to look at going forward. The improved vehicle efficiencies, the focus on land use planning including investments in public transportation.",0.0
False,,Those are more likely to meet the state's climate change goals without compromising the reliability of supply of transportation fuels for families and businesses throughout the state.,0.0
False,,So in contrast to the demand side policies there's a low carbon fuel standard this is a prime example of a supply-side policy it impacts the reliability of transportation fuels and we think it should be reevaluated.,0.0
False,,"It was adopted in 2007, it's half-way through its ten-year compliance period as the Committee's background paper notes the low carbon fuel standard requires a ten percent reduction in carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in California by 2020.",0.0
False,,"But that carbon intensity reduction as, you know, has been frozen at one percent since 2013. So, early in the impact of this regulation as we look to a ten percent as we come out of this freeze at one percent.",0.0
False,,"So in fact, the compliance with low carbon fuel standard is really by ethanol blending and most of the credit sixty percent of them are generated under the program from that.",0.0
False,,The ARB's compliance scenario for 2014 assumed that a hundred million gallons of low ci sugar cane from ethanol from Brazil would be available in the California marketplace.,0.0
False,,So they assumed a hundred-million gallons. In 2014 three million gallons were sold in California. So the program is not seeing at this point in time it's anticipated investments and subsequent commercial availability of these low CI fuels.,0.0
False,,Particularly as we all know in the cellulosic biofuel area. So we think this program on the supply-side it really does rely heavily on fuels and technologies that are not commercially available.,0.0
False,,"And therefore there potentially will have an impact on supply of conventional fuels to the public. Again, we really think the emphasis should be on the demand side policies that many of which have been discussed today in which we totally support.",0.0
False,,So we do encourage serious review of the low carbon fuel standard before 2017. We will be coming out of the one percent freeze in 2016 and the complies schedule is aggressive going forward.,0.0
False,,We really think that program needs to be looked at from as Chairman Beall noted from a cost-effectiveness standpoint where does it fall in when we look at and how close we are already meeting the fifty percent reduction goals.,0.0
False,,So in conclusion while the transportation sector certainly accounts for forty percent of the greenhouse gas emissions and we understand that has to be addressed.,0.0
False,,"There are numerous policies in place today in the cap and trade program, in transportation fuels under the cap and trade program to ensure we meet these goals. and we encourage you again to thoroughly review these existing programs.",0.0
False,,I kind of always like to know where I am before I decide where I'm going. So kind of really looking at where we are with the existing programs and then deciding what that path forward looks like.,0.0
False,,"Some you will find are performing well some are not performing as expected and some are expensive and inefficient. So we would resist a let's throw it all in the basket, let's do all of the above until we kind of look at a rank and see where we are and how close we are.",0.0
False,,And then what we need to do to fill the gap. We encourage again to incorporate evaluation of the policies on how they're impacting consumers and how consumers can be protected.,0.0
False,,There's a lot being done in the electricity and natural gas side of the cap and trade program to protect consumers and we think we need to look at our industry as well.,0.0
False,,"We also note from your questions on the coordination between Committees very happy that the CEC formed petroleum market Advisory Committee they've been having quite a few meetings,",0.0
False,,"and I encourage you to have them come in and talk to you also because they're looking at all of these fuel policies. And, they have indicated they want additional resources to delve into the examination of the impact of climate policies on fuel markets and consumers.",0.0
False,,a great wonderful of the input CRM.,0.0
False,,"That I think will be a very good discussion. So, I would say going forward, and our members, be clear on the goals, focus on demand side policies many of which we've talked about.",0.0
False,,"Be sure that the existing and propose policies don't compromise the reliable supply of conventional fuels for the public. Because that, you know, those gallons are huge.",0.0
False,,"And if you are not prepared to replace them, the program will be set back and that's not what anybody wants to have happen.",0.0
False,,"so make sure the agencies are coordinating. It's very important that everybody's in alignment on the policy and strategic goals that have been mentioned and,",0.0
False,,"again, we just we need to rely on petroleum fuels for a very significant part of the transportation future that's going to be with us for a very long-time far longer than any of these horizons we're talking about here.",0.0
False,,So let's just make sure we bring some more realistic expectations to the conversation as we figure out what we're going to go post 2020. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Good morning Chair and Members. Caliph Assagai on behalf of the California Public Defenders Association. We did submit an opposed letter to the Committee.,0.0
False,,"We've since met with the office and have an agreement to work out our issue, which has to do with identifying which warrant should be considered the original.",0.0
False,,"We're sure we'll come to a resolution, but I just want to acknowledge that we did oppose and we have worked with the author to address our issues. Thank You.",0.0
False,,Caliph Assagai with the California Public Defenders Association in support.,0.0
False,,Caliph Assagai with the California Public Defenders Association we were opposed to this measure based on a jurisdiction issue that has since been resolved with Judicial Council and Assembly Member Obernolte. We appreciate your willingness to work with us and we're no longer opposed.,0.0
False,,"Caliph Assagai with the California Public Defenders Association we are opposed this measure. This can already be charged as a misdemeanor, and we don't think they'll be a deterrent effect by increasing it to a felony.",0.0
False,,"Furthermore, these are the petitions already filed under penalty of perjury. So while we understand what the Assembly woman is trying to accomplish with this, we don't think it adds anything to this area of law. So we're opposed.",0.0
False,,"And that we're working towards better coordination pathway development for students. Thank you, you'll be hearing from a number of our folks, today's their ledge day here at the Capitol, as they'll be wearing those blue buttons as supporting K-12 adult education. So, appreciate the time. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Good morning members, I'm Lizette Everett, on behalf the Community College League of California. I want to thank if your time, and also thank the Governor for allocating $500 million to adult education. We do have a couple of concerns moving forward, one of them being the incorporation of the coming college non-credit funds into the Adult Education Block Grant.",0.0
False,,"These, aforementioned earlier by Donna Burns, these are planes that go into the education of both non-credit and credit in terms of integrated learning. The other is the concern of the lack of a data interface, a state-wide one. As you heard from many students, they don't care who's providing their adult education, they care that they can transition to both, and they can move on into the workforce or careers, and that's really important in a system moving forward.",0.0
False,,"Lastly, as you'll see from a lot of organizations here, there's a coalition really pushing that we have local consortium accountability plans that are--allow for really the analysis of needs, but also really take into consideration the dynamics of working together and  building on that existing collaboration. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Good morning, yes still morning. Judy Heimen, Legislative Analyst's office. The sergeant has distributed a handout that covers both of these next two items on your agenda I'll provide some brief background on Career Pathways Program, followed by our analysis and recommendations.",0.0
False,,"The purpose of this program is to improve career pathways which are sequences of courses in programs often beginning with career exploration in middle school, continuing with courses in high school that combine rigorous academics along with career preparation.",0.0
False,,"The courses are articulated with local community colleges and four-year institutions and the pathway process typically involves regional employers, labor organizations and other stakeholders to make sure that students are prepared for the work force.",0.0
False,,"The states CTE Pathways Program provides grants to consortia that must include at least one community college and one school district working together to help regions develop not just the pathways themselves, but also policies and collaborations that will support these pathways.",0.0
False,,The current program replaced an earlier version that ran from 2005 to 2013 and provided nearly four hundred million dollars over that eight-year period. The new program was funded in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 at forty-eight million dollars each and is scheduled to sunset June 30th of this year.,0.0
False,,"Yes, this is the last year and the Department of Education and the Chancellors office jointly allocate funding to projects and just to give you an idea of some of the types of projects that they fund, one grant is to continue developing model CTE course lessons that are posted on a website for sharing curricula among providers.",0.0
False,,"Another grant is for developing internship and other work-based learning opportunities for students and a third is to provide professional development on best practices for CTE providers. As Mr. Nuzam explained, the Governor's proposing to extend the grant program for an additional year and our assessment of that proposal begins on page four.",0.0
False,,"As my colleague discussed in the last panel, providing additional categorical funding for CTE further fragments the states workforce funding. The state school funding approach and increasingly it's approach to post-secondary education, relies more on accountability for outcomes rather than dedicated funding that's tied to specific activities.",0.0
False,,Extending a categorical program beyond statutory sunset would be a step in the opposite direction and for that reason we recommend that you reject the Governor's proposal to extend this program for an additional year.,0.0

False,,Could you repeat that? I apologize.,0.0
False,,"You stated that, evidently there's a difference between an ocean lifeguard and a sworn ocean lifeguard, and one I want to know about training for ocean lifeguards period: what's involved, and what is what is the difference between the two?",0.0
False,,"It's the opinion of PORAC, Assembly Member, that, well... I couldn't sit here and protest to you that I know the difference because I'm not a lifeguard or a fireman,  I'm a police officer in the State of California.",0.0
False,,The award was specifically developed for sworn peace officers and sworn firefighters.,0.0
False,,"We do, within PORAC, have many organizations that have fire, firefighters as well as lifeguards that are actually firefighters, or that are actually peace officers that their job assignment, their collateral duty assignment at this time, is a lifeguard. They're sworn peace officers, so they are currently eligible if they're sworn.",0.0
False,,I'd like to make a motion to move AB832.,0.0
False,,"Wasn't a question, I was going to move the bill, so I move the bill with the additional provisal that I will work with the author of the bill to find innovative ways to find funding.",0.0
False,,"And in fact anything that we propose that produces any kind of unforeseen economic problem to any entity, I think that the state basically is on the hook for it anyway, and so as it moves out, and your biggest challenge may be getting it out of Aprops, but I will work with you and the Chair of the Committee that handles that, so we can possibly  find a funding source, so it doesn't die an untimely death in Appropriations somewhere.",0.0
False,,"And I'd like to move the bill, I want to thank Mr. Stone for bringing this forward,",0.0
False,,"and I know you and I've been working on this for, ever since we got to the Assembly. We've had this carrot and stick approach to prisons and we use more stick than carrot, and I think at some point we've got to provide avenues in which people are allowed to improve their lives, and learn different habits than they have with the stick approach.",0.0
False,,"When I see this gentleman who sits in front of me, who's out of prison, and has not been in prison for several years, yes I see a man, I see someone that's turned his life around, but as someone who's part of budget, and the Chair of Budget Sub 5, I also see some someone that's not a cost or burden to the state to fifty thousand-dollars a year.",0.0
False,,"Which means he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the general fund, hundreds of million of dollars that can go back to programming for other people who want to get out, but most important that probably will exceed what we need, and we can also use that for schools, for roads, and other things,",0.0
False,,"and so this approach of allowing people to retrain them, to learn different habits through the various programs, I applaud you on that, and I'm going to, obviously, I put in the motion, but I'm also going to vote for this today and in hope that we continue this venue.",0.0
False,,"I've always said: out of a hundred and thirty thousand prisoners, people who are incarcerated, if we just took about twenty-two hundred of them, at fifty thousand dollars a year, we could save the state about eleven billion dollars over a ten year period, and we should really start thinking in those terms about the number of people who don't recidivate how much money we can bring back to our state coffers. So I applaud you on this effort.",0.0
False,,"I will take them in numerical order, starting with AB 672, the Inmate Reentry Assistance.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members. AB 672 requires CDCR to provide transitional services to wrongfully convicted individuals upon their release from prison. Over the last two decades, the number of exonerated in the United States has nearly tripled every year.",0.0
False,,"After spending decades in prison for crimes they didn't commit, wrongfully committed convicted persons are released back into the community without access to basic transitional services such as housing assistance, job training, or drug rehabilitation.",0.0
False,,"Simply put, this bill will provide access to the same services that parollees are able to receive upon release from custody. Here today to testify in support is Obie Anthony and Ignacio Hernandez, who is representing the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice.",0.0
False,,"In 2011, Mr. Anthony, after being wrongfully convicted, was released from detention after spending seventeen years in prison. Mr. Anthony was the inspiration of this bill. He was released from prison with nothing but his clothes and a few dollars in his pocket. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,The Earned Compliance Credit and Reinvestment.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chairman and members, Assembly Bill 926 creates an earned compliance credit report program that provides eligible parolees with the opportunity to reduce the length of their parole upon compliance with their parole conditions.",0.0
False,,Savings from the reduced parole supervision shall be re- invested into job training and housing for state parolees to reduce recidivism.,0.0

False,,"The number of people that are returned to prison significantly drops thereafter with 19.3% recidivating  in the second year and only 6.6% in the third year. if a greater proportion of resources were concentrated in the first year parole supervision, when parolees are most vulnerable to recidivate, the state could more efficiently utilize scarce resources, while helping to reduce recidivism and overall prison spending.",0.0
False,,"I ask for your ""Aye"" vote.",0.0
False,,"With me today is Jennifer, I don't have a Jennifer, okay, with me I have Glenn, not Jennifer Kim from the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, and Darris Young, a former parolee.",0.0
False,,That is correct.,0.0
False,,"Rosa Aqeel, PICO California, a proud sponsor, in support of the bill.",0.0
False,,"Okay I'll have Glenn, but, I just wanted to quickly say, the real premise of this and, when we talk about supervision, the way we've been doing it now, 74% of people recidivate, so obviously to continue to go down the path to the way we're doing now is not working and we need to provide funding.",0.0
False,,"What really got me inspired to do this is to get funding to create a different path or pathway for people to reduce their amount time in prison but also gain some skills using the funding that I've been saying all along since I've been in the Legislature that we need to help people get out reduce the time that they're in prison and then use that money as savings to create a system where they can get drug rehabilitation, get education, and I think this methodology that we're using now will ultimately create a different methodology for supervision.",0.0
False,,It's not about just incarcerating and holding people in jail and then waiting until the time when they get out.,0.0
False,,"If we continue down that path, we're never going to change.",0.0
False,,So what this bill does is start us in doing things completely different than the way we've done before.,0.0

False,,We support the Governor's goals of achieving fifty percent renewables and the broader meeting our 2030 GHT goals and establishing them and meeting them.,0.0
False,,Southern California Edison will achieve 33% renewable energy by 2020 and we can support a broader framework for achieving the 2030 goals. One that looks at integrating renewable energy--much more renewable energy--with energy efficiency and transportation electrification.,0.0
False,,We think that with regard to meeting the and exceeding the state's twenty-three goals going forward and going toward 2050 much more renewable energy is required but we really need to look at all of the tools in the toolbox.,0.0
False,,Utility discoverable renewables are important but distributed generation is equally important as is getting the utility significantly invested in the transportation electrification.,0.0

False,,We know that higher education is the best investment any of us can make in the State of California. We know that right now we there are more people desiring of a higher of higher education then we currently have space for in our CSU and UC system.,0.0
False,,"We all know the impacts that have been going on. While the state has been any huge budget crisis and we've had a cut back, we know that's going to change.",0.0
False,,"That is changing and, we this bill serves to be ready when the economy comes back fully and we're ready to find a new CSU that we have the actual data of where the greatest needs are in order to be able to use our money most effectively.",0.0
False,,So since defending of the California post-secondary education Commission in two thousand eleven we have not had a coordinating body to be able to do this type of work.,0.0
False,,So without having that coordinating body we don't have good concrete data from which to make our decisions. We know that we're going to have at least in two thousand and fifteen forty-one percent of California should have a higher education college degree.,0.0
False,,To be able to obtain the kinds of jobs that will be available and right now they only have about thirty five million. We have at least a million shortfall right now and that is going to continue to grow especially as a population continues to grow.,0.0
False,,So this simple task directs the LAO to conduct a state-wide analysis of the needs for a new CSU. The analysis will look at enrollment demands based on a five to ten year projections of the college-age population and public high school graduates.,0.0

Her grandmother who had been educated for sixteen years told not to do that, you need to go in higher Ed, go to private-sector where you could you be University President and swap more and make seven million dollars in benefits and things that nature.

False,,"But I chose public service like many of us around here and I'm concerned about the privatization of the UC and CSU and the Community College Systems; that we're looking at money, that's the number one factor in how we move forward, the fact that there's a very small group of individuals that make decisions on the budget they're making over five hundred-thousand-dollars that may be more connected to the state budget, than they are with anything else.",0.0
False,,"They're the ones that I'm really concerned with, and how do you change that behavior. You have individuals right now who are very similar to what I'm dealing with the judiciary. There's a small group of individuals in the AOC who make more than Governor, but they make one hundred-percent of the budget decisions that go on, and we find it a lot of the decisions were not in the best interest of the people, and people access to justice, but more important they weren't looking at how to do efficiencies in a way where they didn't need all the money that they claim to need, which is like one-point-two billion dollars. They probably need a whole lot less if they were a little more efficient, but they didn't care in some cases, they didn't care about how to do that in an efficient manner.",0.0
False,,"Right now, you have a game we're going with the UCs, with the people who are making this kind of capital. Where out-of-state students are on a premium for going out of systems, you can pay a premium or more important the students here. if I were them, if they wanted to really be a business enterprise, I would not have said we're going to cap out-of-state students to pay a whole lot of money at two thousand, and keep the in-state-students at one thousand. I would have made a great deal with the money that we would have made off of that, that brought that number to two thousand and anybody, you, me, and everybody in the Assembly and the Senate jumping up and down but instead, we're playing the pun games with people who make this kind of salary on the tuition, on the employees within the system, tuition hikes gone back as a pawn between this body and the UC and they just, like the judiciary say, almost act like we're almost like the third branch of government and the Assembly and others can't tell us.",0.0
False,,"One way we can actually impact this is through the budget, so I applaud you for coming at it through the pocketbook because that is a lot of ways to only you can make people perk up, and then like the lasting that really bothers me is when, and I'm not trying to put UCLA on blast right now, because obviously as I told my colleague from UCLA I would love to make sure UCLA football coach only made a hundred-thousand-dollars a year.",0.0
False,,"And then you would only be able to get a high school coach-to-coach and but that's a whole of the discussion, but the number of African-American students that are being admitted right now into the UC's is abysmal, and I don't feel, there's right now that, there's a real concerted effort to do that. Yes, the UC spent twenty million dollars a year to get minority students into the system, there has been another five million to go international, but, but they are able to be more successful with the five million than with the twenty. That's management, those are the people that are making all these, the people who make the decisions and they're not doing things. I think we're in a best interests, so I think this effort you're doing now looking at the perks, compensations, retirement, housing, employer paid compensation will probably shed a light because I call this the Marie Antoinette kind of analogy, where people at the top who make the decision cannot have this attitude to let them eat cake in hope that they ultimately will get what they want.",0.0
False,,"Whether not doing it a hundred-million or any, before we give the UC any money we need to make sure that they're using the money properly to do what the people of California really want done, so I'm one of those they're very cautious sitting on budget, the Budget Committee about how we move forward from this day forward, so I applaud you on this, I was still a little skeptical because I'm still unsure whether or not they will get the message before that you see for wake up and understand that the Assembly, the Senate, and the Governor very serious about that. Everyone has access to an education here in California and that should be the number one thing that we should be doing, not talking about compensations, deferred payment, houses, drivers and mansions in different place.",0.0

False,,"Madame Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association Advocates. I do want to point out in a way, this is friendly opposition, because Senator Hill has been very gracious to spend a lot of time with us talking about this issue.",0.0
False,,"It's unfortunate that we still remain opposed to the bill. And it's for two very practical reasons. First, I do want to point out that Senator Hill has actually done a bang-up job in his district, in making it clear to his school board, San Mateo Unified, and the people in his community, that he doesn't think that they handled this situation in the best manner possible.",0.0
False,,"And we've always thought, since this issue was first brought to us last fall, that this is an issue best handled at the local level. As we've seen before in other bills where we have a discrete problem in a small area, fixing it with a state-wide fix creates complications in other parts of the state.",0.0
False,,"So on one hand, one example is that different school districts handled the Prop 39 decision about an offer differently. Oakland Unified handles it much like San Mateo, which is, staff makes the presentation to the board, and the board acts on it as San Mateo did.",0.0
False,,"Los Angeles Unified, because they have so many Prop 39 requests, has made a point to shift the responsibility to the superintendent. So the superintendent makes the offer, the board does not take action on that offer. And there's no requirement that they do.",0.0
False,,"And in Los Angeles, that's important, because they get 80 to 100 Prop 39 requests every year. Can you imagine an LAUSD school board meeting, as infrequently as they really happen, having to deal with eight or nine Prop 39 requests at every hearing? Those school board meetings would become Prop 39 meetings. There would be no time to do anything else.",0.0
False,,"The other issue that we have from our standpoint is: the law is very prescriptive, both in terms of the statute, the regulations, as well as case law that's devleoped over the last fourteen years. That prescriptive law limits the amount of discretion that a school district has relative to meeting the definition of ""reasonably equivalent.""",0.0
False,,"Having public hearings and public comment and all that leads the public to assume that there is something else that can be done. That there is discretion at the school board level about which location they can offer to a charter school. And that, in most cases, is just not the case because of the prescription of the law.",0.0
False,,"We don't want to create a situation where there are more upset people because they expect to get something out of a public hearing that they're not going to get, and we certainly don't want to turn LAUSD and other school districts into just a conveyor of Prop 39 requests.",0.0
False,,"And we do think that Senator Hill has been very effective and think that that effort should return to the district, and hopefully San Mateo will be more transparent in the process in the future. For these reasons, we have to oppose the bill. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to clarify two things real quick. One, this is very much an administrative process because it is, so much expertise is necessary to do this that you can't really leave it up to sort of a policy 30,000 foot-level debate.",0.0
False,,"And I do want to correct one thing the Senator said relative to discretion, it is actually the issue of discretion about the location that is, it's hard to have any discretion. When you're talking about number of classrooms, you're talking about square footage, you're talking about all the amenities of the facility in order to accommodate the students. There are very few places in most school districts that would meet the very specific requirements of the offer that has to be made under Proposition 39.",0.0
False,,"Yeah if I may, Madame Chair, Senator Pan, and I appreciate the question.",0.0
False,,"Absolutely, through the chair. What Senator Hill is describing is a discrete situation in his district. And yes there may have been options, but my understanding, and Ms. Kollman may be able to expand on this further 'cause she actually represented the charter school in that situation, Design Tech, is that the location of the school was something that needed to happen quickly, right away, so they could open the school and get things going.",0.0
False,,"The other options were not options that were available. The co-location at Mills High School was always intended to be temporary. And as we understand it, in the next school year, they are expected to be someplace else.",0.0
False,,"And everybody knew that going into it, that this was gonna be the case. But the options that Senator Hill is talking about were not available to the school district at the time that the school needed to be open. They couldn't wait another year or two for other location possibilities.",0.0
False,,"I mean, it does underscore the fact that every school district is different, every school district is gonna have a different set of circumstances, and unfortunately most of them are not gonna have options even a couple years down the road, because the facilities in the school district are very limited, especially in terms of meeting those very specific requirements for square footage and classroom and all that kinda stuff.",0.0
False,,"Madam chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Afterschool Coalition. I really appreciate the description of the program that Senator Hancock has given. Of course we agree that it's completely accurate. We do want to point out that this is a problem that flows from Proposition 49 which we are grateful for but has created a box that's been very hard for us to get out of.",0.0
False,,"That initiative had a dollar amount in it, 550 million dollars, which was great at the time but it has stayed at 550 million dollars since it was enacted in 2002. And there has been no increase in that amount of money. What it's created, plus the statutory requirements of the program, it's created a box that after school programs have difficulty getting out of in terms of their finances.",0.0
False,,And Senator Hancock has mentioned things like the two minimum wage increases. We also have the sick leave change in the law that was enacted last year that requires us to have at least three days of sick leave for each of our employees.,0.0
False,,"Those are all costs that are real costs to the program that we don't have the capacity to budget our way out of to reduce programs, to even raise revenue. So what we're seeking is just as an increase to the 550 million dollars that would accommodate the two minimum wage increases.",0.0
False,,We're not even asking for all the costs. The 17% increase in the CPIs since 2006 is cost of doing business that we have to accommodate and we have to find a way to budget but we're not asking for that. We simply want the two minimum wage increases.,0.0
False,,The reality is the programs are going to get squeezed out of existence if there is not a way of finding relief. We cannot cut ourselves out of it because every time you want to reduce a staff member you have to reduce 20 students.,0.0
False,,"And you're then losing the 20 students worth of ADA. So your revenue loss ends up exceeding whatever you're going to save by cutting a staff person. You cannot, because of the population we serve, ask for parents to pay a portion of the fee.",0.0
False,,82% of our programs are serving people of free and reduced lunch eligibility. That's a lot of families that can't afford $10 a week or any amount to help offset the cost. And we're also already providing by statute 33% in kind or other revenue coming from outside the state.,0.0
False,,"It's a real box that we've got to find our way out of. We know this is also a budget issue but the bill does carry an escalator for future years so we don't find ourselves in this position year in and year out and would allow the department of education to increase it according to the CPI in future years. We ask for your support, thank you.",0.0

False,,Part of the guidelines provided recommended coverage of all seven FDA-approved cessation medication when prescribed by a physician without prior authorization. The elimination of the prior authorization requirement removes an extra barrier in accessing timely treatment.,0.0
False,,The elimination of this requirement also acknowledges that the prescribing physician is capable and qualified in determining which of the FDA-approved drugs are most appropriate for their patient.,0.0
False,,"When trying to quit, it is essential that we remove as many barriers as possible to achieve greater success. By codifying these federal guidelines, ABA 1162 achieves this goal. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"All right, 11 against 1. I like those odds. Mr. Chairman, members, Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans.",0.0
False,,"Regrettably we do oppose, AB 1162. We believe this bill will increase costs to the state by requiring Medi-Cal managed care plans to pay for tobacco cessation drugs in a manner that, that is inconsistent with the Department of Health Care Services policy and sound medical management.",0.0
False,,"To be sure health plans strongly support the importance of aiding individuals in tobacco cessation, and we recognize a staggering economic impact in the human consequences of smoking.",0.0
False,,"That is why the department requires Medi-Cal plans to cover the panoply of tobacco cessation drugs, but with reasonable medical management such as prior authorization under certain circumstances.",0.0
False,,"Unfortunately we do have several concerns with the bill. Number one, the measure requires medical managed care plans to cover all cessation, medications approved by the FDA.",0.0
False,,"And correspondingly, eliminates prior authorization requirements for these drug treatments and this provision alone, we believe is bad public policy. Some tobacco cessation drugs are not safe for all people a very popular tobacco cessation drug, for instance, is known to cause a whole host of side effects including, including suicidal behavior.",0.0
False,,"It's a great drug for many people, but for some folks, it does not work and can be dangerous. Indeed, the FDA in 2013 linked this particular drug to over 500 suicides over a five year period.",0.0
False,,"As a result, some plans do put that particular drug on the prior authorization list. So when we analyze a bill like this we do have to ask ourselves whether my member plans are being asked to pay for the wrong care at the wrong time for the wrong people.",0.0
False,,And we believe this bill opens the door for that and therefore we have to object. We also object to the language that further delinks counseling from the tobacco cessation drugs.,0.0
False,,"My member plans believe that counseling sessions are an important part of tobacco cessation therapy, and can enhance pharmaceutical therapies and maximizes, maximize the chance of quitting.",0.0
False,,The data clearly shows that patients that receive assistance from a clinician are two to three times more likely to to quit smoking for at least five months or more.,0.0
False,,"So, plans in the commercial market or in public programs are expected to be good stewards of either premiums or state funds. There's no provision here requiring the Department of Health Care Service to adjust the reimbursement rate to health plans for the enhanced benefit.",0.0
False,,So while we do strongly support the intent of the bill we must vigorously defend the management of formularies if the cost of this benefit is to remain affordable to the state. So for those reasons we respectfully oppose the bill. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Mm-hm.,0.0
False,,Right.,0.0
False,,Yeah.,0.0
False,,"Well, thank you assembly member. We're not gonna be able to be supportive of a bill that moves, that eliminates prior authorization. Particularly for a drug category that has known harmful side effects.",0.0
False,,"In indeed the Department of Health Care Services policy letter on this issue which is the, instructs the medical managed care plans does require the coverage of all seven types of medications, but it says that only one has to be available without prior authorization.",0.0
False,,"I think that's in recognition to some of the issues that I addressed in my primary testimony. So, you know, my initial thought here is that if his author and his staff were willing to sit down and talk about conforming the bill to the DHCS policy letter, I think we could find some constructive things to talk about. That, that, that would be our preference.",0.0
False,,"If there was, if there was, conformity, that may or may not, that may address our concerns. Of course, I have to consult with my members.",0.0
False,,I have 43 member health plans.,0.0
False,,43. Got it. Yeah so yeah with the majority of which do participate in the medical program and are proud of that. That might be a place where we could at least start discussions. But at this point the bill does not conform to that guidance.,0.0
False,,"That is correct, yeah.",0.0
False,,It is currently being offered to the MediCal population. What this bill does is remove prior authorization from the delivery of those drugs.,0.0
False,,Yes it does.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, it, in, in, in, it, as... I stated in my testimony, there in, in particular there is one drug with, potential very harmful side effects that some plans do put on prior auth.",0.0
False,,"And that, that'll be deployed if you know, those side effects will be relative for that particular patient, but, but, yeah, it is something that is used in the private sector as well.",0.0
False,,"The Department of Healthcare Services requires the coverage of tobacco cessation drugs. The our issue is that it, it this is different than the policy that has been issued by the state and in, in, in a way that we think is harmful so.",0.0
False,,"Jeff Vaca, representing the California Association of School Business Officials in support.",0.0
False,,Sawait Seyoum Health Access California in support.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, Members, Nick Louizos, on behalf of California Association of Health Plans. We have an opposed position on the current version of the bill. We got the amendments like an hour before the hearing so we're still looking them over.",0.0
False,,We'll take a look at those amendments and let the author know whether our position has changed. Again the problem with the existing bill is similar to the bill that Mr.,0.0
False,,"Holden had before the committee in that it removes prior authorization allowance for Medi-Cal managed care plans, on a drug which is oftentimes prescribed for off label use, and that may not be appropriate for all patients.",0.0
False,,So we'll take a close look at the amendments if they change our position we'll let you know. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Amber King with the Association of California Healthcare Districts also in support.,0.0
False,,"Good afternoon. Adrian Shelton with the County Behavioral Director's Association. We also, sent a letter of concern to the office, office, to the committee.",0.0
False,,"The concerns that are, in your committee analysis as well, so we look forward to working with the sponsors and the authors as this moves forward.",0.0
False,,I just wanted to also say that CBHDA worked in collaboration with Senate Pro Temp Steinberg and Disability Rights of California in the last legislative session to make some much needed changes to LPS and,0.0
False,,"there was also a companion legislation SB 82, which provided capacity grants to counties for crisis services. So we also want to ensure that the committee knew about that, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. The rapidly escalating price of drugs is impacting premiums and share of cost for our enrollees.",0.0

False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the Aids Healthcare Foundation, the largest provider, private provider of care and treatment of people with HIV and AIDS in the world, with 16,000 patients just here in California.",0.0
False,,We've been fighting this issue for more than a decade because of the high cost of drugs for people with HIV. This bill is long overdue and we urge your support today. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Yeah to you, to your comment similar to Member Chavez, I think one, one of the pieces of misinformation that is getting out there is that drug prices are not on the rise.",0.0
False,,"And you know, obviously as the payers in the health care system we are very concerned about cost increases in the system.",0.0
False,,"And we'll just say that, the Assemblymember, Assemblymember Chiu mentioned this is in his testimony, but if you look at the top 100 drugs by sales, in 2010, only 26% of those, were $10,000 a year, or per patient I should say.",0.0
False,,"Pardon me. In 2014, that's increased to 47% of those top 100 drugs. So they, they are on the rise. And, and indeed, in, in those four years that price increase and that category increase by 750%.",0.0
False,,"So so, so we are concerned about the trend. We are concerned the tu-, pipeline. There are about 11 or 12 drugs that are going to be introduced or approved I should say by the FDA, that are in the blockbuster category.",0.0
False,,"And then, based on a, an actually, an old analysis, this may be different now, the drugs are actually 14 percent of the premiu, the premium dollar, not 10.",0.0
False,,"I would, with your indulgence, Mr. Chair, I just have to would like to offer to come in and talk to Assemblymember Maienschein and Assemblywoman Waldron about our position on SB-46. I think there's some misinformation that's being delivered on that bill.",0.0
False,,"We opposed that bill because, the information that was provided by the plans, triggered a specific regulatory action, on the plans. It wasn't a pure transparency bill from our perspective.",0.0
False,,We removed our opposition to a follow up Leno bill when it was distilled down to a transparency bill between employer purchasers and labor trusts and the health plan.,0.0
False,,So I'd like to come in and talk to you more about that because I think that's a bit of a Jedi mind trick as part of this debate.,0.0
False,,"Nick Louizos, California Association of Health Plans in opposition.",0.0
False,,"Nick Louizos, California Association of Health Plans, opposed.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair Members, Rand Martin, on behalf of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation I appreciate the summary that that Mr. Nizarian has provided. He actually took half my testimony away from me, but one statistic I do want to point out was that he had not included, is the the fact that despite the fact that we believe that we, if you read the press, that we have control of this epidemic.",0.0
False,,"There are still 5,000 new infections in California alone every single year. That really does indicate that we are far from in control of this of this epidemic. And the reason we're not is because there are populations that are increasingly hard to get to.",0.0
False,,"AHF happens to be the largest provider, as I indicated in testimony on another bill, but we're also the largest tester in the state of California. We did 50,000 tests, last year. We did 3 million tests worldwide last year. So we know the experience, that testing provides.",0.0
False,,"And testing is the answer to controlling the epidemic. Research demonstrates that if people know that they're HIV positive they will change their behaviors and they will voluntarily access care and treatment. So if we can get people tested, if we can get them in to places where testing occurs, we know that will happen.",0.0
False,,We test in a lot of different places. We even have mobile vans that go out to Target shopping centres. And down the street from dance clubs at 3 o'clock in the morning. But the last major institution where testing is not routinely happening is the emergency department.,0.0
False,,"And we all know that emergency departments are melting pots when it comes to the types of clientele that attend an emergency department. We're very sympathetic to the burdens on, on emergency departments.",0.0
False,,"We've done everything we possibly can, short of dropping the bill altogether to try and, eliminate as much of the burden as we possibly can, so that it is a far more routine and far less burdensome, effort in the emergency department.",0.0
False,,"We think it's important to get ahead of this epidemic, we think this is a really good way of doing that, and we ask for your support.",0.0
False,,"And, and, and Mr. Waldron, I simply like to add that we, we've been very careful in this bill not to be prescriptive. We set the overarching policy. But it's up to the hospital to figure how best to do that. And I think that the first thing that they will do is make sure that the emergency is taken care of first. We're not telling them that they have to do anything in one order or another.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, if, if, if you don't mind.",0.0
False,,"I do want to point out. I appreciate the study, and the, and the study is helpful. The study is also in an environment in which HIV testin, testing is very, very prevalent. There's a lot of testing that goes on in San Francisco. So finding smaller numbers in San Francisco is not surprising.",0.0
False,,"The research, and the statistics that the department of public health has on HIV, indicate that some of the worst places are places that are less urban. The more rural areas, the other urban centers that are not in San Francisco or Los Angeles, are actually seeing higher numbers of people who are testing late for HIV.",0.0
False,,"They're already coming down with symptoms of AIDS before they even get an HIV test. And it's those populations that we really need to get to. And the other population is Mr. Ridley-Thomas has pointed out, even an urban center, center like Los Angeles, a lot of communities of color are at very high risk, are not engaged in healthcare. And they find the place to get all their healthcare is still in the emergency department. Very important to get to those people as well.",0.0
False,,"Sure. There's, there's always going to be a population that uses emergency rooms that does not have any coverage and we appreciate that. And I think that we can continue to work on that issue. There, there, Medi-Cal, Medicare and private health now cover HIV testing in the hospital emergency department.",0.0
False,,"There are funds available through the Office of AIDS to pay and through county health departments, to pay for testing for people who do not have coverage anywhere else. Those are funds that hospital emergency departments could take advantage of as well.",0.0
False,,"So we can continue to close that gap so that almost everybody who walks through can pay. And yeah, there are people who can be private pay as well. The te, the cost of the test is actually not that much. It's less than $40.",0.0
False,,"I'm not sure what the hospitals might add to that, but, but the cost of the test is actually pretty, pretty, pretty small for those, who, who could do private pay. I also wanna make one other point relative to the testing sensitivity. The, the, the h, rapid HIV test is 99.7%, sensitive, which means that 99.7% it's right.",0.0
False,,"So, yeah, there are false positives, but they are very, very small numbers. And, yes, that's why we do confirmatory testing, but very few w, confirmatory tests will change the outcome of the initial test result.",0.0
False,,Nick Louizos with the California Association of Health Plans. Latest version of the bill is an improvement over the first one. We also have a support if amended position and want to continue working with the author to further refine the bill and protect health plan enrollees. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Chair members, Autumn Ogden with American Cancer Society and Cancer Action Network, also in support of this bill.",0.0
False,,Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and Members. Tim Shestak with the American Chemistry Council. Appreciate the opportunity to make a few comments in opposition.,0.0
False,,"We have, as we did on last year's bill, we have two fundamental policy concerns with the bill. That the proposed label, the actual language on the label, we believe makes unsubstantiated and unscientific conclusions about the health effects of all flame retardant chemicals.",0.0
False,,"There's no analysis being done of each chemical to determine how it's used, at what levels. Whether there's any sort of exposure and whether those exposures may end up being problematic to a consumer.",0.0
False,,"And secondly, we believe that the bill circumvents the states two existing chemical and product regulation laws that are already on the books. Prop 65 and the Safer Consumer Products Regulation currently being implemented by the Department of Toxic Substance Control.",0.0
False,,"First on Prop 65. The bill currently requires the label to include a general statement and I quote, ""The state has identified many 'flame retardants as being known to or strongly suspected 'of adversely impacting human health or the environment.""",0.0
False,,"As you may know, the Office of Environmental Health Hazards Assessments implement Prop 65 by establishing a list of chemicals that are known to cause cancer or reproductive harm. Chemicals are also listed on the basis of developmental toxicity.",0.0
False,,Specific product labels are only required if a product contains a listed chemical or consumer exposure would exceed a safe harbor level.,0.0
False,,"Yet, under Mr. Leno's bill that entire process is circumvented and require manufacturers to label their products regardless of what flame retardants might be used or whether the available scientific information would justify such an action.",0.0
False,,"In fact, it's our conclusion that under this bill a flame retardant chemical that may not even meet the criteria under Prop 65, or may not even be selected by DTSC as a priority chemical would be called out for special labeling requirements under this bill.",0.0
False,,"Second point on the Safer Consumer Products regulation. As many, well, I shouldn't say as many of you might know, that bill was passed in 2008, so some folks may not have been here at that time, but the legislature did pass a law authorizing DTSC to establish a process to identify, prioritize, and if necessary, evaluate chemicals of concern that might be used in consumer products.",0.0
False,,"At the same time, also evaluating potential alternatives. The current law provides DTSC with a broad array of options in terms of regulatory responses after the scientific evaluation is done. They can do nothing. They can impose use restrictions. They can impose labeling requirements.",0.0
False,,"So they run the gambit in terms of opportunities that they may be able to impose. Just last year the department has started this process. They've identified some chemicals in products, one of which is a flame retardant used in nap mats and again, it's our point that this bill is a preemption of the implementation of that law.",0.0
False,,And we should be at least that information ought to be and that analysis ought to be concluded before you require a broad labeling requirement on products that have not yet even be evaluated by DTSC.,0.0
False,,"A final point that I'll make is that just as there are a variety of different metals, industrial gases. There are a variety of different flame retardants. They're not all the same. Their chemistries are different. And I think it is important to point out that in our letter, U.S. EPA, and I'm happy to pass this out to the committee, concluded just in 2013,  and I'll quote,",0.0
False,,"""During it's review of data on flame 'retardant chemicals and (mumbles), EPA has also 'identified approximately 50 flame retardant chemicals 'that are unlikely to impose a risk to human health.""",0.0
False,,"Even under this bill, you would still be required to check a box yes or no as to whether or not your product contains those flame retardants and chemicals. If the proponents do believe that there are products that should be labeled, we believe there's a regulatory avenues in place for them to pursue that. And for those reasons, we urge the committee to hold this bill, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, Madam Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We respectfully oppose SB 671.",0.0
False,,"Members, from the paraperspective, the emergence of biosimilars or interchangeable biosimilars into the market is a welcome phenomenon. If unfettered, these products could offer substantial cost savings to the health system. Indeed, it is estimated that biosimilar competition for the 11-most popular biologics would save the US $250 billion on healthcare over a decade.",0.0
False,,"So for that reason, we are not inherently opposed to the idea of state law allowing a pathway for these drugs to enter the market, but it has to be an unhindered pathway. That is why we are opposed to bills like SB 671.",0.0
False,,"While well-intentioned, we believe it inappropriately regulates a biosimilar drug market in a way that creates barriers to access and increase cost for consumers. It does this by requiring the pharmacist to communicate to the prescriber about the dispensing of a specific product provided to the patient for no real clinical reason.",0.0
False,,"States do not need to enact these barriers, and we aren't the only ones saying this. The FDA has said that the standards it develops for determining whether a branded biologic is interchangeable with an approved biosimilar, and therefore safer substitution, will be a rigorous process. The FDA has stated that, ""If a biosimilar is designated as interchangeable with a biologic it can expect it to produce the same clinical result as a reference product."" And the FDA Commissioner has stated herself best, as stating that, ""Attempts to undermine the trust in the products are worrisome, and represent a disservice to patients who could benefit from these lower cost treatments.""",0.0
False,,"And there is a basis in law for this position. The Federal Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act statute defines the term interchangeable. ""The term interchangeable or interchangeability in reference to a biological product,"" excuse me, ""that is shown to meet the standards described elsewhere in the law, means that the biological product may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the reference product.""",0.0
False,,"Yet, in a national play, state government is asked to second guess the federal government's authority and expertise on the matter by instituting notice requirements that will make it harder to dispense these products by requiring additional work for the pharmacist, and in essence, placing a scarlet letter, if you will, on the biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar drugs, making them stand out for no apparent reason.",0.0
False,,"We have a drug cost and pricing problem in the US, and it is being felt, not just in the commercial market, but by state government as well. As best illustrated by the Administrations of Reserve of $300 million for the Hepatitis C drugs that incidentally are not even biologics, but in essence we do need help in lowering costs, the costs of drugs, and should not be enacting barriers to access, if a drug has been deemed safe, efficacious, and interchangeable by the FDA, and for these reasons we are opposed to SB 671. Thank you.",0.0
False,,I'll be brief. Good morning madam chair and members. I'm Victoria Rome with the Natural Resource Defense Council. We strongly support SB 555 to promote more sufficient delivery of water to our homes and buildings. Urban water systems deliver treated water under pressure to their customers through miles of pipes.,0.0
False,,"These pressurized systems include large numbers of valves, joints, and connections. With resulting unavoidable water loses. As Senator Wolk stated, reports have found significant water being lost through these systems. Which also means that we have a huge opportunity to save more water by improving water loss management.",0.0
False,,SB 555 would require annual reporting on water loss findings beginning in 2017. Thus providing the information on water leaks and losses on a more frequent and useful basis. The bill also requires that the water audit reports be validated by technical experts who can ensure the reliability of the data. As we grapple with another year of drought it is more urgent than ever that we improve water efficiency throughout the state.,0.0
False,,"SB 555 addresses one important but traditionally overlooked sector where we can save water in a cost effective manner. Please vote ""aye"" on the bill. Thank you.",0.0

False,,Californians have the right to know what is in their cleaning products to make healthy and responsible buying decisions.,0.0

False,,I don't believe they want to go in that direction. And I'm very sensitive to the whole issue of trade secrets.,0.0
False,,"With technology, using a website, and maybe working with the industry and others to make it very clear, maybe even on the website, what things could be harmful to you.",0.0
False,,"I know for a fact what kind of brought this to me in light, we have a colleague that has an allergy. And one time we, he just got a little, a little dot, a little drop of shrimp on him, and he almost died.",0.0

False,,"And then I watch all these commercials late at night, whether it's heart disease, Viagra, whatever, and they mention a litany from diarrhea to death, and I'm like, I feel like I'm overburdened with all the disclaimer on it.",0.0
False,,"We also realize that it's very important to have that. So this bill is about providing information so that we don't have any deaths, and we can make it better.",0.0
False,,I'm open to all those ideas. I'm open to looking at font size. I'm open to looking at grace period for it to be implemented.,0.0
False,,"I'm open, definitely open, to limiting the number of ingredients on a label so that we can reach that threshold that we understand, that we get to with the consumer, that it will be very helpful to the consumer.",0.0

False,,I love where you're trying to go. I don't k now that the bill in its current form actually gets there.,0.0
False,,"And especially when you state this issue, of ages, lower wage workers, women, people of color, immigrants, and not to say anything, I'm somebody with a PhD; I can't understand half the things that I read on labels.",0.0
False,,"So I don't know how helpful it is for somebody that you're trying to protect to have a long laundry list of things that they don't know, first of all, what those things mean for the most part.",0.0
False,,I mean not many of us sitting up here do know what every single label means or ingredient and which ones are dangerous and which ones aren't. And who's got the time then to go look all those things up to see if it's dangerous or not?,0.0
False,,"So it seems to me it'd be a better use of time to have things that are actually dangerous listed for people, and then they can make those decisions.",0.0
False,,And right now what we're asking is to list more dangerous things on. The previous proposition only went to a certain threshold.,0.0
False,,So we're trying to make sure it does become a little more comprehensive to include everything possible.,0.0
False,,I believe there's a compromise to be had. To make sure that the bill moves forward. And I need to get both sides together to get there.,0.0
False,,"Okay, so Madame Chair, I'm, for me this should not be this controversial or just have angst to the committee.",0.0

False,,"Some examples of some admission criteria preferences, admissions requirement that we are seeking to eliminate in the charter school environment include as was mentioned by the senator requiring volunteer hours. I was recently actually this year public advocates put out a piece of research regarding their-- They looked at 500 schools and they found essentially that 30% of those schools and my math is slow, that's probably like 165 schools or so had volunteer hour requirements. Now, that may work if you had two parents and you know, one was working and the other was home and was available to volunteer at the school. Some of these had up to 80, 90 hour requirements a year. So, for a, you know, grandmother who is working two jobs and they may-- that family probably won't even apply to the school when they see the set of requirements. It's a deterrent when they actually see the application.",0.0
False,,"One quick example at Santiago charter school authorized by Orange Unified School District, they require 12 service hours and that parents fill out a form indicating whether they would like to volunteer for those hours or donate money, for every $10 donated, you will receive one service hour credit. That's an example of a kind of discriminatory admission requirements we're talking about.",0.0
False,,"The second one, academic the senator mentioned that also in some cases particularly in San Bernardino, a charter school named Public Safety Academy made headlines this year about having a minimum GPA of 2.0 to get into the school. Now, in some cases, you do have magnate schools as part of a larger school that have a GPA or we've seen gate programs as part of the school. That's different from having a GPA requirement at, you know, the entire school where the charter school is physically is not letting people in who are not achieving well particularly with respect to the fact that in '92 when charter schools were established in the state of California, one of the explicit purposes and I'm reading from ed. code about why charter schools were created was to increase learning opportunities for all pupils with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for pupils who identified as academically low-achieving. So if you're meant to serve low-achieving students, it doesn't make sense to have a 2.0 GPA bar.",0.0
False,,"Increasingly, we have seen these admission requirements and preferences getting more and more creative. One of the most creative ones I saw was here locally at Natomas Charter School that has in their lottery policy, yes it has a performing arts mission and yes they have auditions, I would suggest that as a tax payer and my son takes piano lessons, even if he was really horrible at piano, you know, my tax dollar fund that school, he should be able to attend that school regardless of what his ability is at piano.",0.0
False,,"But specifically in their preferences, they include a preference score, elected adviser to the board and I would submit what is an elected adviser to the board. To me what that means is a school board sits together and maybe they elect somebody who's kid gets a special preference to come into that school. Those kinds of creative preferences, it should not be allowed, they're discriminatory. And so what we're looking at here is-- and these are the result truly of like an hour of Google research on the internet. So, if those are the once that are public, you can imagine how many other types of admission criteria and preferences haven't been put out to the public and are also, you know, limiting student access at charter schools. Charter schools are public schools. They must be available to all students. We urge your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Thank you madam chair. Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association, I want to start with a couple of comments. One, we really appreciate the fact that the author has spent some time with us this week especially and we really appreciate your work on this and your staff's work.

We're taking one last look at it but we feel optimistic.",0.0
False,,"I do feel obligated to say though in response to the supporters that charter schools do not adopt the mission requirements and preferences unilaterally without oversight. They are part of the petition process. They must go to the school district and the school district must approve them. So if there are preferences and if there are admission requirements, it must be done with the approval of the school district, a very important distinction that was not apparent in the supporter side of the presentation.",0.0
False,,"The second piece of the bill has to do with the disciplinary policies. The proposal as it is right now would impose an additional 53 education code requirements on charter schools. When some re-regulation of charter schools is proposed, the first question out of our mouth is always is, what's the justification? Demonstrate to us that there was a problem.",0.0
False,,"So far, we have not been able to get the information that justifies the problem. We have taken effect. We have witnesses here to talk about this. We have taken the data from CDE on suspensions especially expulsion data unfortunately is not as good as suspension data. We have used the same methodology that UCLA has done in their unreleased report. We've not even seen it, so people are quoting it. We're not sure how they're quoting it. And have found that our experience with suspensions is actually better than traditional public schools. We suspend less students than traditional public schools.",0.0
False,,"The references to national studies, keep in mind that we're a 50-state country and post national studies are looking at all of the 50 states. They are not looking at California specifically or exclusively.

False,,"We feel very proud of what we do relative to disciplinary policies and I should point out once again disciplinary policies are approved by the school district. They are not approved unilaterally by the charter school. And they are outlined in great deal. If anybody has ever seen a charter petition, it is not this thick, it is this thick. So all those things that are in two pages in the statute are actually in four or five two-inch binders and they include expansive information on disciplinary policies. So we can-- if people demonstrate to us that there's really a problem, then let's talk about it. But that has not been demonstrated, we've-- as repeatedly for data that justifies the need for this portion of the bill and have not received it.",0.0
False,,"The last two items in the bill, I'll hit very quickly, there are changes to the notification process where a student leaves a charter school. Again, we're not sure why that's necessary, dropping the time frame from 30 days to 10 days is a challenge for charter schools. Anybody in education knows that there are times when students leave school and don't come back as fast as you would think they would. Not quite sure where they've gone, family emergencies, family vacations, where the schXTool is not notified. In 10 days, we don't necessarily know why the student left or whether the student is coming back.",0.0
False,,"We're also concerned about handing documentation-- confidential documentation to the school district if we don't know for sure that the student who does leave us is going to go to that school district. We're handing them student level, instructional data. We're providing them HIPAA data that is protected under state and federal law and handing it to a school district when they don't know the school, the district is going to take that student is a liability against us and a liability against the school district.",0.0
False,,"The last piece on teacher turnover, we actually think there might be something useful. We don't think it should be district level. We think the policy should be set at the state Department of Education and then have the districts implement. Otherwise, you're going to have a thousand different data collections that may not match. You're not going to have any comparability for that data. We think if it flows from the state down to the district, you might actually get something that could be useful to everybody. For those reasons at this point, we are opposed to the bill. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"My name is Daniel McLaughlin. I'm the founder and CEO of the One Purpose School. We will serve a population of 97% free and reduced lunch actually in your district, Senator Leno.

False,,"And with respect to restorative justice, we did have a long conversation in the last legislative session around willful defiance, around the idea that we need to figure out ways not to send kids home, that we need to figure out ways to provide supports for kids, and to be blunt, none of that conversation had any impact on the charter school environment because at charter schools, the education code that we're talking about there with respect to suspension and expulsion is waived.",0.0
False,,"So in other words, they weren't required necessarily to follow some of those provisions that we were establishing that truly represent a good practice at all California public schools. So there is explicit ed code that says in terms of alternative to suspension and expulsion, that rather than send a child home, a principal could implement several alternatives to suspension and expulsion. One of those explicitly in code being restorative justice.",0.0
False,,"So in putting forth a requirement that charter schools comply with the suspension and expulsion provisions of the education code, it also then delineates what are some reasons that a child could be suspended from school, what alternatives are kind of best practices recommended through statute that a principal could use rather than send a child home.",0.0
False,,"So in essence, I would say just the opposite. It would encourage the use of alternatives and explicitly restorative justice enforcing charter schools to comply with the suspension expulsion provisions of the education code. Some of the data that the opposition was referencing with respect to suspension and expulsion what the data shows is very incomplete because there's not a requirement to use the suspension and expulsion provision. So then to rely on what that data says when a district is not obligated to report that data-- I'm sorry, a charter school is not obligated to report that data in the first place is extremely problematic.",0.0
False,,"Just kidding. I would say there's two sides to that conversation. On the one hand, I know that recently, both the Charter Schools Association and-- not recently, I would say two years ago maybe. There was a conversation around what kinds of protections a charter school should have if they were being sued by the public. Would it be similar to a traditional public school if there was a safety issue? And the conversation was just locally actually around Sacramento High School, charter high school where for example a child is not automatically suspended or expelled for example for sexual assault or for bringing a weapon to school and does that create a different standard of safety?",0.0
False,,"So in the one hand, I think that's part of the conversation, but I also hear what you're saying about do some of these zero tolerance policies impact flexibility? Certainly, the conversation around Senate Bill 420 was just the opposite. It was a conversation that was focused on how do we essentially stop sending kids home, which is not helping kids and instead help those kids.",0.0
False,,"So in-- again in requiring compliance with the suspension expulsion provisions of the education code, you bring that conversation to bear on the charter school community as well and encourage those alternatives. That's truly where the-- That's the direction we're heading in the legislature and we think it should apply to all public schools whether traditional or whether charter.",0.0

False,,Evaluation is already based on multiple factors and teachers are already a part of the process of determining evaluation procedures as of course they should be. But introducing the design or the selection rather of evaluation standards into the negotiation and collective bargaining environment is a fundamental change.,0.0
False,,"Simply, think about in these terms. We are going from developing evaluation standards to negotiating them. That is a tremendous change. This creates the opportunities as my colleague said for stakeholders to leverage important evaluation standards related to student achievement or gains related to salary or negation.",0.0

False,,"We have been having conversations with the administrators, with school boards, with the Charter Schools Association, with Classified School Staff to bring forward the best policy. And I know that this committee last week considered bill by Senator Pavley which was about a very small authorizer that placed the charter school outside of its school district and what I want to clarify is that that was an isolated incident.",0.0
False,,That there are several tiny districts throughout the state where they're authorizing charter schools when they don't have either the capacity to do that kind of oversight and so I know that my colleague from California Virtual Academy is going to talk about some of their structure and some similar things that we've seen in different areas with authorizers across the state.,0.0
False,,"But the questions we were proposing as stake holders is number one like what are-- let's better define what exactly are your responsibilities and obligations with respect to oversight and number two, what do you need to have in place to carry out those duties.",0.0
False,,"And so what this bill suggests is that when you're considering what kind of support you have from parents, from teachers to establish a new charter school based on the petition that you also consider a report about your capacity which hopefully will be useful in determining what staff you have in place to do that important oversight work.",0.0
False,,"Do you need to build new structures? Do you need to have new staff etcetera. We were pleased to see that in the opposition letter from the Charter Schools Association, that appear they agreed on that point. That it would be useful for a school district to assess how it will conduct oversight.",0.0
False,,"Additionally, this bill suggests that when a new charter petition comes forward, we also consider what the impact is going to be on other school districts-- sorry, other schools where the district has oversight capacity. In most cases charter schools are authorized by a school district although we recognize some could be authorized by county office, some by state board.",0.0
False,,"The idea is that the authorizer takes a look at their charter schools, takes a look at their traditional public efforts to provide better coordination. And develops a plan for all the schools that they're responsible for oversight looking at things like the geographic distribution of schools,",0.0
False,,"projected demographic changes and that new charter petitions that come forward are evaluated in respect to how they impact that plan. What we have seen from voters is-- before any charter schools approved, voters would love us to conduct an analysis of the impact that the school will have on neighborhood public schools. The public doesn't want their great neighborhood public school harmed by decisions that are made by their elected officials.",0.0
False,,"In the polling data we see basically it's that school down the street two blocks down where I send my kids has a great for foreign arts program, has a wonderful library, has a science lab, whatever you're doing as a district don't impact this great neighborhood school. So what is this bill about? This bill is about what all Californians want which is a great school in every neighborhood. We urge your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Madam Chair and members, Nancy Chaires Espinoza with the California School Boards Association. As you know current law does not allow a local education agency to deny a charter petition even if the school board or county office knows that doing so would result in negative certification or if they know, they simply don't have that capacity to provide the necessary oversight.",0.0
False,,This bill would provide that ability which we think is very important and in some areas where there are-- where there's declining enrollment or w have small rural school districts for example this is a particularly important issue so we respectfully ask for your support for this measure.

False,,"Thank you, Madam Chair and members. Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association. We really appreciate the work of the committee and certainly the author in agreeing to take out the negative fiscal impact portion of the bill that was the biggest part of the bill that we objected to but we are still very concerned about the bidding practices piece.",0.0
False,,"I do want to point out that as Mr. Bramble indicated, we did think-- do think the idea of the school district doing some analysis on their capacity to do oversight is really helpful and we think that they should be doing that not as a reason to reject the charter but so they can prepare themselves to do the right thing when the charter is authorized.",0.0
False,,"And hey, they make sure that they put the right resources into it. I do want to comment on one of the comments that the-- one of the CAVA representatives made about the oversight of this-- of the charter schools from tiny school districts. For those who may not be aware charter schools have to pay anywhere from 1 to 3% of their revenue to the oversight district.",0.0
False,,So a very tiny school district that's authorizing a school that has 3000 students in San Diego is bringing in $300 000 from the charter school. I think that's enough money to pay for sufficient resources to be doing aggressive oversight. I think Madam Chair in your comments on SB 322 earlier today really hit the nail on the head relative to that bill and this bill.,0.0
False,,"The problem is really about oversight and as you've instructed us and I'm taking it back to CCSA, let's see if we can come up with some ideas to strengthen oversight but clearly, resources is not a problem. We're paying a lot of money to school districts to make sure that we're doing out job.",0.0

False,,So it's impossible for us to fully analyze the impact of these amendments on the bill. We do know from a cursory glance of the language that we are still in opposition to the bill.,0.0
False,,"The prior approval piece coming out we do believe is important on the heels of the debate over Prop 45, however, there are still several issues with the bill that we have and are likely to have moving forward.",0.0
False,,"First and foremost members, the bill is very cumbersome and in certain respects suffers from a bit of an identity crisis in that the first section of the bill requires health plans to report aggregate large employer data to the Department of Managed Healthcare and the Department of Insurance.",0.0
False,,And part two of the bill requires health plans to then further report individual large employer data to those regulators as well for the purposes of regulatory action and based on triggers. What we fear would be a consequence of putting these provisions into law is really the loss of innovation and large group market.,0.0
False,,"Based on a survey that we conducted a number of years ago, we found through our members that there are about 14 to 15,000 large group policies in the state of California. The large employer market is highly customized. It's not standardized like the individual or small group market.",0.0
False,,"That's because employers sometimes want more, and they're willing to pay for more. For instance, some employers will initiate a wellness program or things of that nature as part of their benefits to their employees. And of course the health plan is there to help them to design those benefits.",0.0
False,,"If we lose customization in that market as a way to avoid regulatory action or review of the rates, large employers are also in a better position to self-insure their products, which means that if they do that, that escapes essentially any type of oversight by the state or requirements of state legislation for the most part.",0.0
False,,So that is just a public policy consideration for legislators to consider if we keep adding to the administrative load of the large employer market. We will also say that through the Affordable Care Act health plans in all markets have to comply with a medical loss ratio.,0.0
False,,"So what this means is that 80 to 85% of the premium dollar by law, federal and state, has to go to medical services. The remaining 20 to 15 is reserved for necessary administrative expenses in rate of return.",0.0
False,,"So if premiums remain flat or if they go down or if they go up, you know, in our view that is a true reflection of the cost of care for those products.",0.0
False,,"Furthermore, as noted by the supporters, we negotiate at the end of last session and removed our opposition to Senator Leno's SB1182, which allows large purchasers, including labor trusts, to request from the health plan claims data that they can use to review the costs.",0.0
False,,So we don't understand why in the first year of implementing that bill we need to be back here debating that information being sent to the state.,0.0
False,,"We're in the first year of implementing that bill in Senator Mitchell's committee Senate sub three, the DMHC requested, and I believe those positions were granted, positions that would help oversee the implementation of that bill.",0.0
False,,"If the sponsors of that bill are running into problems with our member health plans, they can come to us and talk about that. But that bill was a negotiated agreement at the end of session between us and the sponsors of the bill.",0.0
False,,We're facing several cost drivers in the healthcare system. Drugs are on the rise. Provider consolidation is a problem. We face several challenges. Health plans do what they can to negotiate the best rates that they can on behalf of the purchaser.,0.0
False,,So we're highly opposed to the bill and ask you to vote no. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"They would be subject to rate review and if they hit a certain threshold it would be, they could be deemed at unreasonable by the regulator. It's my understanding. I mean, again, the bill is just being amended today so there would be a regulatory action associated with that filing. It's not merely pure transparency.",0.0
False,,"So, you know, we don't have a cost estimate for this particular bill but a rate review bills for a large group in the past have triggered Department of Finance opposition due to the state cost associated.",0.0
False,,"I don't have a dollar figure associated with particular bill yet, but because this triggers individual filings we would expect at least the cost to be high.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, yes we do expect this to be expensive for the companies, again, we are just reviewing the amendments but I would require that hiring of new staff, actuaries and other types of staff in order to prepare what we think will be volumes and volumes of individual filings.",0.0
False,,"Again, at, for my testimony the large employer market is highly customized. There are thousands of different policies.",0.0
False,,"Some employers actually have different policies agreed to even with the same health plan, so a health plan may have a contract with a large employer for various products within their company, so it's highly complicated in customized business.",0.0
False,,"It's a fair question. Senator, again, we're going to have to review the amendments. If the factors, we believe the factors are, conflict with which might be currently cataloged by the health plan.",0.0
False,,Good afternoon Mr. Chair and members. Connie Delgado with the California Hospital Association. Here in opposition for two main reasons.,0.0

False,,"Well, there are existing penalties that CDPH has that are for the, under the EMTALA regulations, under those guidelines.",0.0
False,,"This bill would create a separate scheme with additional penalties for that that are higher than the current, so essentially it's the current law plus and additional higher penalty.",0.0

We certainly appreciate and share the author's concern about opioid drug abuse which of course results in far too many overdoses and deaths. This is why health plans in part utilize medical management controls that prevent the expenditure of premium dollars on abusive behavior. So it is a serious problem for America, but however, we do not believe that this bill will significantly curb the abuse of these drugs as eloquently laid out by Mr. Caldwell.",0.0
False,,"Our association typically opposes new health benefit mandates because they drive up health care costs for enrollees in the individual and employer markets. New mandates may conflict with the federal Affordable Care Act rules regarding essential health benefits. According to those rules, states have to pay 100% of the health exchange subsidies to consumers for the cost associated with new mandates that extend beyond the essential health benefits. Mandates reduce the flexibility in benefit design for large employers. They also increase premiums.",0.0
False,,"On this last point we do believe that this bill will increase costs for the purchasers of health care. The, this committee as well as Health Committee could have benefited from the independent analysis by on the premium impacts of this bill. As is the usual process for mandate bills. As, as noted by Mr. Caldwell, this bill has been introduced in a number of other states and in those states, the fiscal notes indicate premium increases as a result of that legislation.",0.0

False,,"Yes, Mr. Chair because it and just want you to know, and, and maybe we just, you know, we get wrapped up sometimes into naming things. And maybe banning the box was not the correct title, cause we're not really banning the box. We're, we're holding off when you check the box.",0.0
False,,"Temporarily suspending that time until the end of the application. That's really what we're, we're asking for. And as far as someone's criminal record, the main goal of this is to get our society used to have informally incarcerate come back into society.",0.0

False,,"California has a distinct and separate process for laying off teachers and for dismissing teachers, and those two processes are totally separate and must remain separate. They serve totally different purposes and they're both very valuable.",0.0
False,,The dismissal process is about competence. The dismissal process is about performance.,0.0
False,,"And so, in that process, an evaluator comes in in the beginning of the year. They take a look at what an educator is doing.",0.0
False,,"If they see an area of deficiency, often they make a recommendation about some professional development that that educator may need, and they come back later after they've given some time to improve. They circle back and see if that teacher hasn't met that bar.",0.0
False,,"There's no time to improve tied into the layoff process because it's meant to be a quick slice of your work force For example, you need to reduce 100 positions because of budget cuts.",0.0
False,,"The due process also associated with those two processes are totally different. On the one hand, in a layoff process what you'll generally see is a challenge to the seniority date.",0.0
False,,"It's meant to be a quick, efficient process that preserves teacher experience. And, even in a large district, where maybe you are laying off 50,100 folks, you can accomplish that within a week.",0.0

False,,"There are some situations where the Principal is totally overwhelmed and sometimes not doing an EVAL, or just checking folks off. And in a really problematic process, there are some principals that are still doing their own thing.",0.0
False,,"They're ignoring whatever's happening in the district and what they're doing. I had a Principal that passed out a book to the teachers and said, ""I'll be evaluating folks based on this book.""",0.0
False,,"Or in a worse case scenario, exhibiting things like: favoritism, retaliation, discrimination, and all those things that seniority is meant to protect against.",0.0

False,,"The idea of tying ev... Uh, layoffs to an evaluation system is really problematic and erodes those seniority rights.",0.0
False,,We strongly oppose.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, Education Code 44955-D is very clear in giving a district the authority to deviate from seniority when somebody has the, when, when there is a position... Sorry, when there's a class that's needed a very particular set of training for that course of study, including the training, Including the experience, including the appropriate credentialing.",0.0
False,,"So, what's very common, you know, a couple years ago when there were huge amounts of layoffs, was to skip over special ed teachers, was to skip over math teachers, hard-to-staff subjects like science. That was a regular practice to deviate from seniority to make sure that you had someone in that position.",0.0
False,,But the intent is to preserve your experience in a quick slice but preserve those areas where you absolutely need someone to fill that assignment.,0.0
False,,"Well, I know that there was some conversation earlier about collective bargaining,with respect to the layoff process. And that is a subject that is open to the collective bargaining process if there's a desire to do something unique with in terms of the layoff process.",0.0
False,,"What also is, occurs is that a district will often create its own skipping criteria that's approved in a board meeting, where they'll make a decision about how, for example, they might deal with a tie if there's two people who have the exact same hire date, how that will be dealt with.",0.0

False,,"Secondly, we are concerned about duplicating reporting requirements and information that is already available to parents and members of the public.",0.0
False,,"And lastly, I wanted to address one of the suggested amendments in the Committee Analysis that pertains to collection of aggregate data on teacher evaluations.",0.0
False,,"Some of our members are also concerned that, particularly in small and rural schools, they just don't have the numbers to meet this requirement in a way that protects the confidentiality of teachers. So, we would support deletion of that language as well. So, we respectfully ask for your no vote.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, Seth Bramble here, on behalf of the California Teacher's Association, respectfully opposed to Assembly Bill 1248, which does significantly erode certificated employee rights that are critical to attracting and retaining high quality educators.",0.0
False,,"This bill does two things, really it extends to a 3 year probationary period, in addition, though, has, hasn't been discussed too much.",0.0
False,,"It also gives a district the ability to remove someone's permanent status if they got a series of negative evaluations. Understand, if a district is not happy with the performance of an educator, they should remove their employment, not remove their due process.",0.0
False,,"What this suggests is that you would be removing someone's due process rather than simply removing that person. If someone's getting a series of negative evaluations, you've determined you don't want them anymore. You move through the dismissal process.",0.0
False,,"We've spent a lot of effort in a bipartisan effort last year really prioritizing, streamlining, ensuring that that process Is less costly, is more efficient, and still preserves due process.",0.0
False,,"But it doesn't make sense to have a situation where someone has been teaching, let's say 30 years and now, because they've gotten so expensive in terms of the system, that we now remove their due process.",0.0
False,,"And just release that person, with no ability to challenge what occurred. So it does open a door to those kinds of conversations around age discrimination. The current length of probationary period encourages good personnel practices and supervision by the principal.",0.0
False,,"We heard the support witness talk about an 18 month period. To break that down, if a evaluator comes in, a brand new teacher sees, you know, something that they don't like, in the beginning of the year, in the evaluation process.",0.0
False,,"And identifies some professional development, some areas that that educator needs to improve and then comes back later in the year and that educator hasn't met that bar, let's say 6 months later they haven't, reached the level of growth that the evaluator expects.",0.0
False,,"They still can essentially say at that point, hey here was the bar. You didn't make the bar. You've got 6 months to show me something or you know, you're gonna have to be non-reelected. It's a hard thing, you know, to do certainly.",0.0
False,,"I was non-reelected my first year actually of teaching in San Jose when I taught In high-needs community of color there. But what I would say is, I've talked with a number of administrators who have no interest in going to a 3 year evaluation period.",0.0
False,,"What, wha, sorry, a 3 year probationary period. The primary reasons for that is, principals always wanna give an educator every opportunity to improve. And as a result, would likely be holding folks who they know probably should be picking another profession for a third year to continue working with kids.",0.0
False,,"They would rather make that decision after 2 years. They felt that time was sufficient to make that decision. Taken as a whole, the proposals within Assembly Bill 1248 would move California in the opposite direction of what sensible reform entails.",0.0
False,,"And that is recruiting, retaining quality teachers. These changes would make education an incredibly insecure profession. And would essentially do away with due process which has a potential to erode academic freedom, a quality that must remain the touchstone for any public education system. We urge your opposition.",0.0

I think the question truly before the committee is whether to expand parent trigger law Into county offices of education through this appeal process. Does that make sense?",0.0

False,,"Too often and in too many places, education systems has turned into a, a situation of teach, learn, test, and then punish. Parent trigger laws ignite controversy, not parent school community collaboration.",0.0
False,,The implementation has caused a great deal of disruption in every location that it's occurred throughout this state where there's been an attempt to pull this trigger.,0.0
False,,"We hear from parents about folks circulating a charter petition that says would you like a new water fountain at your school, sign this petition. Would you like all the kids at, at the school to get a new laptop, sign this petition, or in the worst case if you don't sign this petition, your family may be deported.",0.0
False,,Those kinds of really extreme disruptive environments are not good for kids. The author paints this is as a situation where parents are rising up. I would say that that's not the case that's occurred in every implementation of the parent trigger in the State of California.,0.0
False,,"What's occurred is Parent Revolution, a group of well-funded outside agitators come into a community. They target a community where the scores are low, they target those communities, move in, and set up shop, so what you have here is a group of outsiders doing this work and it.",0.0

False,,"We think the bill, as as amended, is very strong and provides some some relief to those charter schools that wanna do blended learning, but don't wanna trip over the current funding determination process for non-classroom based schools.",0.0
False,,Mr. Levine has outlined what the bill does very well. The only thing I would additionally point out is that non-classroom based charter schools are not allowed to be eligible for facilities funding like the SB 740 Program in Prop 39.,0.0
False,,"One of the amendments that we worked out with, with your office, Mr. Chair, is ensuring that those programs that are blended learning would still be able to maintain their eligibility. Provided that they're otherwise eligible for the programs. For those reasons, we really appreciate your help and look forward to moving this bill forward, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association.",0.0
False,,"We're concerned that charter schools don't have to follow most of the education code. And initially, this bill seemed to make attempts to deregulate blended learning which was already subject to very little regulation. That said, we really appreciate the amendments that were taken and I am hopeful after looking at the language that we'll be able to remove our opposition.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Thurmond, I appreciate, appreciate the question. It, the funding determination process is confusing even to those of us who deal with it a lot.",0.0
False,,"And what it's intended to do is to deal with those that are non-classroom based, that have no bricks and mortar. The schools that are bricks and mortar, that want to do blended learning, want to do blended learning in a range of ways that could dip below that 20% mark.",0.0
False,,"We've put a new floor in at 60% because we believe there needs to be a floor, but we didn't want to penalize them if they went to 79 or 78%. Because if they did, they would lose a lot of money.",0.0
False,,"And so giving them the flexibility, giving the State Board of Education some control and some accountability, as I know the Chair was very concerned about, ensures that the money is being spent and the money is being spent appropriately delivering an educational model to the kids.",0.0
False,,"Backing all that up, of course, is the audit process that the state controller's office does on all schools, charter and, and traditional schools, to make sure that the money that is being spent on the things that they're supposed to be spending it on.",0.0
False,,"So, so a blended learning school that's going below 80% is gonna have to justify, is gonna have to prove that they actually delivered education. Even if all of, of the 100% of the minutes was not in a traditional bricks and mortar, but was in another educational mode at a factory or at a, not on, off site somewhere.",0.0
False,,"We know we've got one in El Segundo that's right across from Boeing. They take their kids to Boeing and actually do some of the more practical applications of what they're learning in the classroom, right there in an engineering site.",0.0
False,,"So, those are the kinds of things that we would do with the accountability of the state board. The accountability of the controller's audit process and the funding determination.",0.0
False,,"It's, it's not actually a percentage. The funding determination process as it works now, it's based on regulations and criteria the state board has developed over a number of years.",0.0
False,,"And what they do, is they look at the cost of operating a, in this, in, in current law, a non-classroom based school. And they make a funding determination, how much they're going to pay in ADA to that school based on their costs.",0.0
False,,"They would do the same thing for blended learning charter schools. So if, if there is a reduction, it would be a reduction reflected on off of their costs being less than they would be in a 100% site-based school. If that makes sense, but, it's not, it's not, it's not as clean as what you're talking about, which is, if you're not there for 5% more of the time, you get a 5% reduction in your revenue.",0.0
False,,"What it is, is if you're there 5% of the, less of the time, we're gonna look at it and figure out what you deserve, based on your cost for your ADA.",0.0
False,,"And later if, if you prove, if you can't prove that you've maintained that, we're gonna take even more money away from you.",0.0

In more state funds needed to back filled due to decertification, plus whatever else is on this budget agenda that you have that, that was excellent by the way.",0.0

False,,"It's not necessarily that there's not a lot of cullet, I'm sorry, cullet is recycled glass. I should probably back up and stop using terms, it's a weird term anyway, there's just not enough of it, quality material in California to meet the demands of what they want, as all the proponents said, there's enough incentive for glass manufacturers to use recycled glass, there's already the incentive is there, you don't need a lot to tell them to do it.",0.0

False,,"Again, I'm gonna reiterate, they would go higher in California if the quality supply existed, if furnace-quality cullet was available, they would do it.

False,,"They probably wouldn't be able to meet that, and as a result, under this bill, they would lose their processing fee offset, which I think is actually the goal of the sponsor, is they actually want us to lose our processing fee offset and actually increase our manufacturing costs, despite everything else that's been said.",0.0

False,,"Mr. Chair, members, Tim Shestak with the American Chemistry Council, for the reasons stated. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"I want to clarify something. Californians Against Waste is right up to a point, he's underselling it. For glass, it'll be a 100% elimination of the processing fee offset. The beverage manufacturers are the ones getting the offsets, so that our customer gets it, and if the plants that are supplying beer bottles, cause that's what we're talking about is beer bottles, cause that's what's in the program.",0.0
False,,"If they don't meet the minimum content standard, the beverage manufacturer doesn't get the processing fee offset, which is somehow passed onto us, but it just won't be met. There's not enough material in the marketplace to meet the standard. Just not enough. The Glass Packaging Institute is in other states lobbying for bottle bills.",0.0
False,,"We want bottle bills, we want beverage recycling programs to work, and we lobby for 'em, and we're part of initiatives to pass 'em. We're a unique state, and the cullet supply is not there to meet the standard, and this bill essentially serves as a backdoor way to take our processing fee offset away, making our product uncompetitive.",0.0
False,,"If I can, just for what it's worth, the out-of-state manufacturers and the in-state manufacturers, they're all the same manufacturers. So in the end, the money's coming out of the same company.

And it's gonna all come from California mostly, it's not coming from these non-bottle bill states, it'll get shipped to Oklahoma or to Oregon, not Oregon because Oregon is a bottle bill state, or Colorado.",0.0
False,,"And that'll cost money, and just the increased demand alone, it's a supply-and-demand argument. It's gonna be expensive. And our product is competing against container types that are cheaper.

False,,"Mr. Chairman. Tim Shestak with the American Chemistry Council. You heard our arguments on this bill in a previous hearing, but I would just want to touch on a couple points.",0.0
False,,"We have two fundamental policy concerns with the bill as drafted and this is the notion of taking general class of chemicals and without assessing whether those chemicals or how they're used in what amounts, analyzing whether there's any potential for exposure, and then drawing a conclusion that these chemistries, regardless of any of the facts that may result from any sort of an analysis require a special label for these consumer products.",0.0
False,,"And I think the second point I'd make is that we believe this bill circumvents existing regulatory programs that are in place that are designed to address these very questions and oppose, if warranted, similar regulatory requirements.",0.0
False,,"So, as the bill is drafted, it currently requires a new label to include a general statement that the state has identified many flame retardants as being known to or strongly suspected of adversely affecting human health or development.",0.0
False,,"As you guys know, Prop 65 requires the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to establish a list of chemicals that are known to cause cancer or reproductive harm. Specific labels are only required if the product contains illicit chemical where consumer exposure would exceed a safe harbor level.",0.0
False,,"Under Senator Leno's bill, manufacturers would be required to label their products regardless of what flame retardants they would contain or whether the available evidence would justify such an action.",0.0
False,,"I think in my view it's akin to just essentially having a label that says this product contains or does not contain chemicals. The label, such a label would be meaningless, because there's really no assessment or, I guess, recognition of chemicals or how they're used.",0.0
False,,"Each has a different health and environmental profile. How they're used in products is not the same. Exposure levels are not the same and certainly potential health and environmental impacts are not the same. So, without answering these questions, the bill concludes that certain products should carry a special label, generalizing that this product could be harmful to consumers.",0.0
False,,"So, I think that's certainly a major fundamental concern that we have with this precedent of lumping all of these flame retardant chemicals under one heading, but interestingly enough, the state does have a program in place to answer these very questions.",0.0
False,,"To assess chemicals and products and answer whether or not regulatory requirements are in place and, as you know, that program is currently being operated by the Department of Toxics.",0.0
False,,"That program offers, authorizes DTSC broad regulatory authority from banning chemicals outright to imposing labeling requirements if, once they go through that assessment process determine that perhaps a labeling requirement is warranted.",0.0
False,,"Just last year, one of the first products what was identified was a flame retardant chemical used in certain juvenile products.",0.0
False,,"So, the second policy, principle that I think this bill violates in our view is that regardless of that assessment and regardless of that regulation that DTSC is currently implementing, this bill would impose a new labeling requirement on these products.",0.0
False,,"So, from our standpoint, just as there are different industrial metals, different industrial gasses, there are different categories of flame retardants that should be evaluated and those specific questions should be evaluated on how those chemicals are used and in what products and what potential exposure scenarios might take place.",0.0
False,,"So, for those reasons, we are currently opposed to the bill. I would, the other point I would add and this is really not our issue, but I know some of the manufacturers have raised this issue is that this bill would require companies who don't even use these products or are not even adding flame retardant chemicals to their product would require an additional label indicating that no, we don't use those products.",0.0
False,,"From a general standpoint, a policy standpoint, that's another issue that I'd like to raise, but for these reasons, we do respectfully oppose the bill as it's currently drafted. Thank you.",0.0

False,,"Well, what happened in Arenda definitely seems you know, somewhat dramatic and I want to be very clear that we're not defending any one particular school districts handling of the situation.",0.0
False,,"What is clear to me is that ultimately, the right thing happened. The way this process works is that the school district gathers information and one way or another, has a conversation, exchanges information with the family in question.",0.0

False,,"if this kind of business is conducted in private. What we didn't intend in establishing charter schools was that we would give a charter school total authority to do whatever they wanted with the tax dollars that they receive. The establishment of charter schools was not us, the public, yielding control to the agencies that serve us.",0.0
False,,"In fact, we insist on retaining control and on staying informed.

So I'm talking about the last two months and found seven additional instances.",0.0
False,,"Happy to walk through those if you guys, desire, but what this bill is saying to charter schools is by all means do what you want but do it out in the open where everyone can see. That's why we're talking about open meetings, that's why we're talking about public records. What this bill truly is saying is dream big and think outside the box,",0.0

Also like to point out that, the statement that there are no regularly scheduled audits of charter schools is perplexing. I suggest you ask the superintendent of public instruction whether any schools or schools districts are audited.",0.0
False,,"And he will tell you, they all are. The controller audits them. We also have to do private audits that are shared with our school district authorizers. Our authorizers oversee our finances. To make those statements in support of this bill is really very surprising. And I really didn't want to talk about that, but those things had to be responded to.",0.0
False,,"So I do want to get into what I do want to talk about, and that's two things. One is CCSA does agree that the law needs to be clarified, and we've made it very clear over many, many years. That the law needs to be clarified. We support changes to the Public Records Act. We support changes to the Political Reform Act.",0.0
False,,"We support changes so that the Brown Act that include charter schools.

False,,"School districts had a lot more options to pursue in order to get through that period. The charter schools did not. We had to turn to our board members, we haven't had to turn to our founders and our staff just to keep our doors open.

False,,"many of our charter schools may not have survived, because they wouldn't have been able to turn to these people and ask for help because they were board members and they would be prohibited from helping. Or we'd have to say we'll take your money but you can no longer be on our board.",0.0
False,,"We're simply asking that a provision of the law that is so draconian when it comes to an organization, like a charter school. Needs to be excluded from this proposal. I will say, and, and many of you are new, and many of you have not heard this before. And I hope that you don't have to hear it as many times as we have had to hear it.",0.0
False,,"But the reality is this is an issue that has been down this road several times. This is an issue that the governor has made clear, in 2011 with AB 360.

False,,"Sure. Mr. Thurmond, thank you for the questions, and hopefully I can explain this concisely. First, please understand that 1090 is an absolute statute. There is no wiggle room, there is no recusal not even a question of whether you benefit or not. If you are on the board of directors, you cannot engage in any financial interaction with the organization on whose governing board you sit.",0.0
False,,Does not include contributions.,0.0
False,,You could make a donation.,0.0
False,,"Absolutely. So, charter schools, unlike school districts, often depend, especially during their opening phases, depend on the benefits provided by founders, by board members, people who are committed to making sure that the charter school is open and runs successfully and can keep the doors open, and that's not always a whole lot of people.",0.0
False,,"Some charter schools may do really well in the long run relative to fundraising, but early on, and also in periods of recession like we recently experienced, we often turn to people who are so passionate about the school, that they have committed themselves not only financially, but also to its governance.",0.0
False,,"And so when you have somebody who's willing to step up and, for example, provide a better than market rate on a facility that he or she owns that can be used for the charter school could even arrange a lease that's at zero, it's still a lease, and it's still a contract.

False,,"Just to be clear, our experience with it is it's very absolute, and it could be zero dollars, but as long as a contract is involved, like a lease, it would apply.",0.0
False,,"Well there's the deferral issue we had members sitting on the board of directors who actually loaned money sometimes at zero or a very low rate, in order to get them through, and that was, you know, it was a real help to many charter schools.",0.0
False,,"I appreciate that, and you're absolutely right. We can't work it out in committee this afternoon. And look forward to talking. And again, most of you have not been down this path before so you haven't had the experience of talking about this, like Dr. Weber has many times in the past. So, what you're referring to in the 49% is the Corporations Code.",0.0
False,,"And because most of our charter schools are incorporated as non-profits, they are governed by the Corporations Code. The 49% is a threshold beyond which you cannot go in terms of financially interested parties. Meaning, for example, teachers sitting on a board of directors, people who are employed by the corporation.",0.0
False,,"It still does not mean that you can engage in a contractual relationship in which you have a conflict of interest. The corporations code is abundantly clear. About conflict of interest, relative and if you have a conflict of interest, this is the big difference with 1090, under the corporations code you can actually recuse yourself from the vote.",0.0

And hopefully, the data that you collect, those of us that are on the committee that are a little more skeptical, with your data showing that is a proven program that helps reduce recidivism.

False,,"But most important, bringing people who are out of state as far as Oklahoma and Mississippi and Texas that are our prisoners, back to California. And to do it in a comprehensive way. That's why we're asking for long range so that this legislature and this body can plan for that.",0.0
False,,"And say with the LAO, how can we take those savings and then plow them back into more recidivism programs so that number can keep going down, keep on going down.",0.0

So, we think there's a remaining problem here with respect to affordability and potentially access. So, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Hi, Nicholas Chavez here on behalf of the California Association of School Transportation Officials. Want to align our comments with Michael Hulsizer of Kern County. And we'd like to request the adoption of the funding for SB191 in the appropriation assembly budget. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Good afternoon, Lizette Everett on behalf of the Queen College League of California. Again, wanna thank the administration for a very strong proposal and the investment in community colleges. As we see they're tiny populations and times where those students need a place to go.",0.0
False,,"Community colleges are always there for them, so we thank for the investment. Specifically, we wanna thank the administration for the unallocated resources, as been stated by several before me.",0.0
False,,"These resources will ensure that we can cover retirement costs, as well as the increasing health benefit cost and other energy costs that have continued to go up. We are strongly in support of the Governor's vision and direction for equity.",0.0
False,,It's time to address the long standing systemic equity issues that exist on our campuses that affect all of our students. And we need an approach and plans that can help all of our students close those equity gaps. We're supportive of the 75 million augmentation for full-time faculty.,0.0
False,,"Our point would be to ensure that those can be flexible resources so they can address other faculty related issues such as part-time faculty office hours, etc. And overall we're also in support of the direction of the basic skills grants but wanna ensure that all colleges can participate from those resources.",0.0
False,,All of our colleges have basic skills needs and this can be beneficial to ensuring that students complete on time. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Yes, thank you Madame Chair. Tamara Rasberry representing San Diego Gas and Electric. Also concurrence with my colleagues from my sister utilities. And our concern is that this Trailer bill language clearly circumvents the policy process and raises significant policy concerns.",0.0
False,,"One being that it appears to benefit federal government and not federal government military bases and not to military personnel. And though the Trailer bill appears to attempt to apply the NEM 1.0 rules to the federal government's buildings, it could set up a situation that allows the federal government to",0.0
False,,"avoid paying costs that other NEM 1.0 customers do pay. And ironically, some of those could be non-military customers or as well military personnel who live off base. And at a minimum the Trailer bill should require the federal government to pay for all system upgrade costs and technologies required for the safe and reliable operation of the utility system. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Madam Chair and members, Carl London here on behalf of the California Disability Services Association, we're an organization of approximately 100 community based agencies throughout California that serve this population.",0.0
False,,"Wanna express our support for the Governor's May revise, relative to the developmental centers, kind of in line with Senator Stone's thinking. We obviously know this is gonna be a process, but we wanna urge you to look very carefully at the resources, what we do with the developmental center resources over time.",0.0
False,,"Every other closure we've had, the resources go away. They evaporate after closure, the community gets nothing. Also passed out for you a reminder of just the history of the rates in California, and what we've done in the past 13 state budgets.",0.0
False,,"This community has not had but one increase over that time period in 2006, seven, and that was promptly taken away a couple years later by the legislature and Governor, because of the falling out of the economy and the state budget overall.",0.0
False,,"Restored in the last couple of years, but only restored to 2006, seven levels, so one rate increase, you basically, the legislature and the governor's offices asked community based providers to provide the same level of care to 280,000 people at a 3% increase over a 13 year period while consumer price index, alone, has risen over 30%.",0.0
False,,"It's impossible to do from a business standpoint. You don't make up negative numbers in volume by doing more, and this budget has to recognize rate increases for this community, and we urge strongly that you include that we're appreciative of Senator Stone's comments on this again.",0.0
False,,"I want to applaud him particularly coming from the Republican Wing, and looking at reinvesting and putting money, I'm glad that he's brought himself to the party quite frankly.",0.0
False,,But and the last thing.,0.0
False,,"Well your good friend Ms. Grove is on the same page too, so.",0.0
False,,"The last comment I'd make is I also dipped my pool into the volunteer side of things. I'm now, unfortunately, a board president of a local agency in Sacramento and we're at the point today where we are losing staff because of money.",0.0
False,,"That creates great instability among the people we serve and in this population, stability is everything. Please include a rate increase in this budget as you move it back along to the Governor. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Madam Chair, members. Carl London on behalf of the California Disability Services Association. We certainly support the staff recommendation in you agenda.",0.0
False,,"Would like to make one further comment and recommendation, and that is that we consider, as we're talking about developmental center closures, that we consider adding additional language that prioritize closure for those units where we have already lost the federal funding, or at significant risk for losing the federal funding.",0.0
False,,"That ought to be the highest priority for closure as we move forward with planning that, no matter what the process is, because it means more dollars out of the general fund.",0.0
False,,"And away from everything else that we would all think money should go towards in the state budget. So, we'd ask you to, consider that as well. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Yeah. Madam Chair and members, Carl London on behalf of CGSA. I want to, you know, a huge ditto to what Senator Stone had to say.",0.0
False,,"It is awfully hard to look at the January or May revision of this budget with absolutely zero in this budget, to benefit community-based programs for this population that desperately needs it.",0.0
False,,"And then also propose, in the same breath, that we give away a property, and assets that have been serving this population for decades, at zero cost. That is incredibly frustrating to look at.",0.0
False,,"The legislature can make a policy statement if it wants to, and we would urge you to do it. To look at these properties as an extension of the service system.",0.0
False,,"Grab them and at least take part of this back to the community, so we can serve this population fairly. And in accordance with the Lanterman Act.",0.0
False,,"To do otherwise is to just strip us of property and assets that have been serving the community or this population for a long, long, time. As we look at Sonoma, as we look at Fairview, Sonoma, has been in service for many decades.",0.0
False,,We can't just give this stuff away for free. It's awfully hard to feel great about the education system getting a free chunk of land out of our community. And getting nothing in return in the Governor's budget or the May revision. Thank You.,0.0
False,,"Madam Chair, members, first of all, thank you for the opportunity to speak on these items all day long today so thank you. California Disability Services Association, Carl London on behalf of them, we support this as well.",0.0
False,,"We're very excited about this, this has been on our radar for the last three years and the 20% number seems fair because we do have to worry about balancing the model of integration for our populations. So well done.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Madame Chair.  Jenny Bellow with the Legislative Analyst's Office.  On this issue, we appreciate that by using an existing infrastructure the department is able to get this funding out without reserving any of it for administrative costs at the state level.",0.0
False,,"That said, on these drought proposals we are suggesting that departments report to the legislature on the expected outcomes of this investment. How they will be measuring those outcomes and how they will be reporting those outcomes back to you, so you have some information to evaluate whether or not the investment returned the outcomes that you expected.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Madame Chair. Jenny Bellow with the legislative analyst office. On the issue of the in home supportive services case load, we've requested some backup information from the department, are continuing to look at it, and we'll advise you if we spot anything that we think is worth talking about.",0.0
False,,"On the issue of the Fair Labor Standards Act, you're faced with several elements of uncertainty here, the first being we're not sure when the federal courts will ultimately issue their decision, what that decision will be, and if there will be further appeals.",0.0
False,,"Secondly, if they do decide that states need to go forward with implementing Fair Labor Standards Act new rules on overtime, it's not clear how much lead-in time they'll give us, or how long it'll take us to get our systems up and running.",0.0
False,,"So the administration has decided to deal with that uncertainty and that risk by building in a full year of costs, to support paying for overtime for IHS providers. The legislature could decide to deal with that risk differently.",0.0
False,,"Clearly there are trade-offs, by providing a full year of funding for it in the budget year, it means you have less money freed up for other priorities, so those are the types of trade-offs and things you'll have to be thinking about.",0.0
False,,Move the bill.,0.0
False,,"Chairman Gomez, committee members, my name is Matt Regan. I'm here representing the Bay Area Council. We are a business sponsored, public policy, advocacy organization. Comprised of about 300 of the largest employers in the San Francisco, Silicon Valley region.",0.0
False,,"According to the latest Franchise Tax Board Data, we have about 20% of the state's population and just produced about 40% of the state's income taxes. So, we know that knowledge based economies are successful economies, we know that they help balance budgets.",0.0
False,,"But our problem in California is that we fail to produce enough high school graduates to meet the needs of that knowledge based economy. And why is that? Well, we looked back into the early years and reverse engineered the problems. It's not necessarily all on the heads of high school teachers.",0.0
False,,"We noted that a third of kids entering kindergarten in California currently lack the basic skills to compete with their peers. They lack the social, emotional skills, the self regulation and cognitive skills, to meet the levels required of them in kindergarten. The solution is to invest earlier.",0.0
False,,"Upstream, we know that a child's brain develops all of it's architecture in the first five years of life. We also know that investing in the early years produce significant returns to state coffers. According to the president's council of economic advisors, that's an average of $8 to every $1 invested.",0.0
False,,It can go as high as $16 to $1 according to the data and research done by Nobel Laureate James Hackman. That's for the kids most at risk.,0.0
False,,"Okay, so the savings come from reduced rate repetition and need for remedial education in our K-12 system. So we would urge an aye vote, it's good for our kids, it's good for our economy and it's good for our state. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Steve Cruz on behalf of San Mateo County. I understand it might be parsed off separately but we're supportive of the back affiliate of the insufficient in ERAF piece so, I appreciate that. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Brian Euler, LAO.",0.0
False,,"Just briefly, I think your agenda does a pretty good job of laying out our sort of overarching comments on this issue, so I'll just speak briefly to one of the points that you raised, and one of the outstanding issues that's mentioned in your agenda and that's the interest rates on the successor or the city agency loan agreements.",0.0
False,,"I just wanted to provide a little bit more background, Mr. Hill sort of touched on this issue that in the initial dissolution statute, these loan agreements, initially they were invalidated and a little bit of the background behind that is there was concern that many of these agreements weren't sort of arm's length transactions, and that they were structured in ways that resulted in, you could say sort of unreasonably high interest to cruel and large payments from the agency to the city.",0.0
False,,"And one of the ways that was done was with high interest rates. There were other ways that was done in terms of deferring payments or making interest only payments or just in the way that the payments were structured, and so were only talking about sort of one of those elements here in terms of the interest rate.",0.0
False,,So that's sort of the background of something to keep in mind when you're thinking about what's the correct interest rate on reinstating these loans. To the extent the legislature still has some concern that some of these loans being reinstated may have been these types of non [UNKNOWN] transactions sort of deals that provided inflated interest payment to the city then looking at the interest rate and perhaps providing something that's modestly lower then what the variable interest rate at the time back in the 80s or 90s was may be one way of addressing that concern.,0.0
False,,"That's correct, right. And I guess I should say, I don't mean to implicate every single city agency agreement, I'm sure there were many that were very valid, and were arm length transactions.",0.0
False,,But there were certainly anecdotal evidence of these types of transactions that weren't.,0.0
False,,"Good morning, I'm Susan Riggs, acting Director of the Department of Housing and Community Development. And we have been working very closely with the city to exhaust all administrative remedies. At this point, the administration has not fully vetted the proposal, and does not have a position.",0.0
False,,"Good morning, I'm Susan Riggs, acting director of HCD, again, and this is not a proposal that is coming from HCD. But I'm happy to provide some background on the programs that are being proposed, to the extent that is something that's helpful.",0.0
False,,"Okay, so the Joe Serna Jr. program is something that is not currently funded. It's a program that allows for the construction or rehabilitation of housing for farm workers, for agricultural workers. In the past it's provided housing for agricultural workers in much of our agricultural areas in California.",0.0
False,,"The OMS, the Office of Migrant Services program, again, is not currently funded. We have 24 OMS Centers throughout the agricultural areas in California. We do have some deficiencies in terms of the maintenance in our OMS centers around about $12 million,",0.0
False,,"$6 million of which has been covered by other sources so there are some outstanding maintenance issues there that are currently not funded. The Self Help Program is primarily a technical assistance program. It's capped at about $300 million in technical assistance, assistance for folks that want to self help in providing their housing.",0.0
False,,"It's not technically a rural housing program, but often times, it is used in rural areas. And then finally the $250,000 for Napa County Farm Worker Housing. Napa has been proactive in constructing three farm worker housing facilities in their community that are currently underfunded, and they're requesting some support in order to maintain the operations of those facilities.",0.0
False,,At this point we have not vetted the proposals and do not have a position.,0.0
False,,"Tim Lynch on behalf of the Napa Valley Vintners and specifically we're supporting the $250,000 augmentation for the Napa centers. These are unique around the state and a blend of funding from the county, self-assessment on the growers and rents that the farm workers themselves pay.",0.0

False,,"Hi, Danielle Blacet with the California Municipal Utilities Association. We wanted to support Proposal 823 regarding drought penalties, but I wanted to echo my colleague's comments regarding the consolidation proposal.",0.0
False,,"We think this is a super important issue that needs to be addressed, but we do think it is a public policy issue. That it belongs in a longer and more robust process than a budget Trailer Bill. Some concerns we have is the scope and application of the bill is poorly defined.",0.0
False,,"We know there are communities that are running out of water. We wanna see those issues addressed. However, the way the language is written right now, there's several terms in the bill whether it's the best means to provide water to the systems feasible, there's adequate and affordable financial assistance.",0.0
False,,"What is a failure to provide potable water? All of these terms are not defined, the way the language is written does not apply strictly to drought situations, it's to all consolidation efforts, so these are our concerns.",0.0
False,,"There's clarifications in the state drinking water plan as Ms. Ritterbush outlined, and also in the intended use plan, that the State Water Board is prepared for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund that could help clarify some of these issues.",0.0
False,,"And then also something that I wanted to mention, I know there was some discussion today among the members regarding the consolidating systems, maybe not doing the right thing. But there's actually some situations where the system that would be consolidated are refusing to do so.",0.0
False,,"So it creates some situations for a system that does wanna do the right thing. But when they go to try and consolidate with the system, they're not able to. And then also, on the liability protection concern, we also wanna make sure that's fully addressed. So those are my comments, thank you so much.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, good afternoon. Robert Gore from The Gualco Group on behalf of Imperial Irrigation District, Kings River, and Kern County. First of all, on behalf of fee payers we'd like to thank the water board for noting in 823 that it will decrease the demand on fee payers.",0.0
False,,"We appreciate that commitment. On 825 also, testimony indicated that many small districts have a negative value. I think that's worth remembering as we perhaps increase the demand on fee payers. Overall, we'd like to associate ourselves with the comments of Mr. Reed and Ms. Ritterbush and commend the administration for trying to manage this crisis.",0.0
False,,"It's immense and innumerable, as we know. Lastly, virtually all members of the committee noted that there's been much imprecision and many assumptions made. There may be a way to address this with urgency bills as opposed to a trailer bill language. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Danielle Blacet with the California Municipal Utilities Association. We have two Trailer Bills we want to comment on today. First is 823 the drought penalties bill, we support that. We definitely wanna see those penalties go towards conservation activities.",0.0
False,,"I also wanna echo the comments of my colleague Ms. Ridderbusch on the consolidation proposal. We do have some concerns, we know these communities are running out of water, we wanna be, our members wanna be a part of the solution but we do think that the language in the current proposal is overly broad.",0.0
False,,Terms are poorly defined and we wanna definitely work with you all and the administration and the water board to make sure that it's a proposal that works for drought situations now and then also to address the ongoing issue of consolidation and how our members can help.,0.0
False,,"Good afternoon. Steve Cruz on behalf of the California Building Industry Association. We had comments on the groundwater, the CEQA exemption for groundwater. We're not opposed to the CEQA exemption on permit for new wells.",0.0
False,,"That's sort of an immediate action, but there's a second part of the language in section two, that addresses an exemption for ordinances adopted related to land use decisions, including a temporary moratorium.",0.0
False,,"And so, as we see that, you'd be exempting those decisions that are made, sort of on a long-term planning basis for housing that are sometimes ten years out. That could actually have the opposite effect of, if you're in a job rich Bay Area, for instance, and there's a CEQA exemption.",0.0
False,,"And there's a move to help new development in one area. Then you're actually sort of further commute time. Just as an issue, I'm not sure that was intended, I heard Senator Pavley sort of speak about it. But we're going to be meeting with the administration next week to talk about it. But I just wanted to flag it. I'm not sure it's intended, but that's the way it's written currently. Thank you.",0.0
False,,Good afternoon. Lizette Everett on behalf of the Community College League of California representing the CEOs and trustees of all of the colleges in the system. Just to echo. Including Orange County.,0.0
False,,"Just to echo the comments previously stated, maintaining unallocated resources is very important for our colleges, again to restore some of the loss and ensure that we have adequate efforts to serve students at all levels, prepare for future retirement cost as well as growing health and energy costs. So thank you.",0.0
False,," Good afternoon, Lizette Everett on behalf of the Community College League of California. I want to align our comments with the chancellor's office with regards to adult education.",0.0
False,,"We think it's very valuable to collect data. This will be important as you move the initiative forward but do have concerns about the 49 million for data not being part of the pre-split, and also what that means for implementation pressures on.",0.0
False,,The Chancellor's office since they are not receiving staffing to do that but think it's a valuable proposal.,0.0
False,,"Also want to state that we are in support of the administration's proposal with regards to full time faculty and actually would even say that keeping that more flexible would allow for more part time parity, office hours and some of the other elements that this committee has identified as priorities.",0.0

False,,"Lizette Navarette, I'm representing the Community College League of California. Again, just want to reiterate the strong support and thank the committee for continuing your support for equity funding.",0.0
False,,This is an important issue at our colleges. We think it's important to finally address the systemic long equity gaps and opportunity gaps that exist at all colleges.,0.0
False,,"And these efforts have a lot of momentum that you will see in the years to come as it continues to implement great programs that will effect all of our students since a lot of them come from a lot of need from diverse backgrounds, and this is really important.",0.0

False,,"Nicholas Chavez with the California Association of School Transportation Officials and the School Transportation Coalition.

False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair, members, Jeff Fokker representing the California Association of School Business Officials. Associate myself with Mr. Chavez's remarks. There are very small number of JPAs that provide transportation funding in this state.",0.0
False,,"We don't believe that it would be inconsistent with the local control funding formula to allow those JPAs to receive direct funding. The school districts would actually reduce paperwork An administrative burden on those school districts, and so we would just like to have this, continue this conversation. Thank you.",0.0
False,,Mr. Chair and Committee. Michael Pimentel with the California Transit Association.,0.0
False,,Thank you. I'd like to thank...,0.0
False,,"Yeah I know. Thank you. I'd like to thank the committee and the staff for the additional attention paid to transit in this item, it's very much appreciated.",0.0
False,,I did want to make a comment however on the 25 million for transit passes. Transit passes can have an impact on transit ridership. However there is some past experiences with free passes going really to subsidize existing riders.,0.0
False,,"And so, while that may be a good thing for things like transit equity, we're not sure that it gets to the results and the exact outcome that we hoped to get from the Cap and Trade program.",0.0
False,,"We generally understood investments from cap and trade to go toward new services, new operations. And so if this appropriation is sustained, we look forward to working with the committee and the administration to make sure that this works well.",0.0
False,,I'll put a note that what we can ask for this form of additional transit assistance. We understand why groups that did ask for it support it.,0.0

False,,"Good morning Madame, Chair and members. My name is Jay Hansen, and I am a Vice President of the Sacramento School Board. and a member of the California School Board Association. Our school district serves 43,000 students in 84 schools with the help of approximately 4,000 dedicated employees. I'm here to urge your yes vote on SB 277",0.0
False,,"for two key reasons. Number one, is the most obvious, for the health and safety of our students and the school community. Just a few weeks ago, two of my schools, Judah Elementary and Einstein Middle School, had cases of whooping cough. When that happens, those schools must take several immediate and potentially costly actions.",0.0
False,,"The school district's Health Department must be immediately notified. They in turn, must contact the County Health Department to report that a vaccine-preventable disease has occurred. Our district health staff then prepares a notice specific to that illness to be sent home with every child at that school.",0.0
False,,"Every staff member at the school is notified, so we ensure a consistent message for the students and the school families. And we want to ensure the students take the note home to properly inform their parents. When it is warranted and more serious, the school principal can also make a robocall to each of the families to make sure",0.0
False,,"the message gets through. And we also work with the local media to get the information out. That's what can happen when one student has one illness. Multiply that by hundreds or thousands across the many thousands of California schools, and you can imagine the complexity, cost and disruption to the education of every other student.",0.0
False,,"Two months ago, you and the rest of the world heard about the measles outbreak here in California. It quickly spread to 10 counties, and required three different schools to quarantine many of their unvaccinated schoolchildren for three weeks until they could be safely determined to have not contracted this potentially life-threatening disease.",0.0
False,,"Once again, in addition to disrupting the education of many, many schoolchildren, and causing unnecessary anxiety to thousands of families, the cost to these school districts and the local health authorities is great. And of course, we cannot forget the children who contracted this easily preventable disease,",0.0
False,,"because they could be in for a lifetime of medical complications. The number two reason I urge a yes vote, gets to the foundation of education and how we teach. In our schools, we are teaching our children how to think, how to do math, how to read, how to write, what science and biology are. We believe and celebrate the scientific method.",0.0
False,,"It is a foundation of learning and discovery. By asking our students to be vaccinated, we are affirming science in action. There does seem to be a certain willingness to consciously disregard straight science and is a bit mystifying to me. It is mystifying to our students as well. They learn about the Great Flu epidemic at the turn of the century",0.0
False,,"that killed millions. They learn about the ravages of polio, that crippled hundreds of thousands just a few decades ago. As a school board member, and as the Education Committee, we should stand up for the scientific method we all learned in school. You ask a question, you do background research, you construct a hypothesis,",0.0
False,,"you test your hypothesis, you analyze your data, and you draw a conclusion. Members, we have done this many times over, with some of mankind's deadliest diseases. And we know how to stop measles, whooping cough and countless others. Vaccines are proven to stop these diseases, and that's what students learn also.",0.0
False,,"Our schoolchildren deserve to be safe and healthy, and to have an education that values science. This bill is another step in that direction. It makes the right choice, and it honors the work of science. I'm also proud that the School Board Association, representing all of our states' 1000 plus school districts, are in support of this bill.",0.0

False,,"Good afternoon at the end of a long committee meeting that I hope will go quickly now. Thank you for taking the time to hear this today, Mr. Chair and members. Today, I'm presenting two bills. The first one is 1193. Oops, my talking points just went away.",0.0
False,,"It's dealing with a law called Laura's Law, otherwise known as Assisted Outpatient Treatment. It's an evidence based treatment program that in certain circumstances provides treatment to those who have a severe mental illness.",0.0
False,,There are many criteria that must be met before a person with a mental illness may qualify for AOT including endangers to themselves or others and multiple hospitalizations due to mental health issues.,0.0
False,,The purpose of AOT is to keep people with severe mental illness in the community and in the least restrictive environment by providing additional support by supporting someone so that they may remain in the community.,0.0
False,,"We don't think that threatens anybody's civil rights because it is much better than often times being hospitalized and or incarcerated. Since its passage, AOT has been implemented in nine counties across the state of California, and this bill will encourage more counties to implement AOT but will not require that.",0.0
False,,"So, currently there is a continuum of mental health issues. The most non-restrictive, of course, just being voluntary outpatient. There is an intermediary where it is much more intensive.",0.0
False,,"And, then of course sometimes people have to be 5150'd and or hospitalized and or put into a conservator ship. This we think is a step before somebody has to be hospitalized, assisted outpatient which can be then court ordered.",0.0
False,,"And, we see more and more family suffering, patient suffering and I often use the analogy, often times mental illness itself will tell people I don't need any help, I'm okay, and to me it's somewhat analogous to someone having a leg cut off after a traffic accident and saying, no, no, no, I'm okay, I'm okay, just leave me here.",0.0

False,,"When it was first implemented it was optional, counties had to opt in. And, because it's been slow to be adopted, and we think it's a really good, we've got enough evidence now to know that it works, that we'd like counties to be able to opt out versus opt in.",0.0
False,,"And even that process of being able to opt out, at least people are having the conversation. Mental health issues are one of those things, and as a licensed clinical social worker, I certainly have been on the end of having to hospitalize people and providing a lot of treatment.",0.0

False,,Thank you very much. I'm glad to add you as a coauthor.,0.0

False,,"So, that's just what this bill does, just to be able to say it clarifies that danger or risk of harm shall not be limited to eminent, or right in that moment, to themselves or others and requires consideration and only consideration of the historical course of a person's mental health issues",0.0

Its genesis was the Consumer Protection Enforcement Initiative, commonly known as CPEI, which our Deputy Director for Enforcement will be discussing later.",0.0

The first release of BreEZe went live in October of 2013. During development of the first release, it became apparent that there were major issues we had to address.",0.0
False,,"The design work, as the Auditor stated, for release one, was inadequate. The scheduled time for testing was inadequate. And the costs were going to significantly increase, perhaps by hundreds of millions of dollars, if changes to the contract were not made. Many of the problems that were identified",0.0
False,,"were confirmed by the State Auditor and its report on BreEZe. By the time the audit was under way, we were already working on corrective action. That corrective action involved working closely with the Department of Technology to negotiate a new contract that would allow the state to better manage the project",0.0

False,,"through the new system. If the committee wishes, I'll address the six issues that the committees wanted me to address in my testimony. The first of these issues has to do with the status of BreEZe project. Given the delay of the Special Project Report, also known as SPR, 3.1.",0.0
False,,"And whether the Department is planning to shut down BreEZe or working to reduce costs ending legislative action.

Third, the Committees have recommended that we explain how BreEZe charges were calculated for Boards and Bureaus and SPR3.1, especially with respect to those Boards in the third release. In addition, the Department has been requested to share how those costs will affect license fees",0.0
False,,"and how any deficiencies will be met. The BreEZe project costs are allocated amongst the Boards and Bureaus based upon their respective share of DCA's overall annual initial license applications and renewals. Only the Boards and Bureaus in the first and second release will pay for the design, development,",0.0
False,,"and implementation, also known as DDI contract. That is the large contract, that for the most part, we're talking about. The programs in the third release are only paying a share of the initial hardware, software investment costs and not the DDI contract. Although BreEZe may be a contributing factor,",0.0
False,,it is not solely responsible for fee increases at any of the Boards or Bureaus. There are many other factors that may contribute to a need to increase fees. We closely monitor the fund conditions of all of our Boards and Bureaus and have identified 17 whose funding is projected to drop below the three month reserve.,0.0

False,,"after due deliberation, determined the best way to control escalating costs was to sever the contract with our vendor after the second release. The other two options, namely stopping the project or pausing the project would have resulted in substantial financial cost to the State. As I mentioned previously,",0.0
False,,"we will do a cost-benefit analysis after the second release has concluded to determine how best to proceed for those Boards and Bureaus in the third release. Absent any findings to the contrary, our vision is still to bring those Boards and Bureaus into BreEZe. The Boards and Bureaus in the third release",0.0

We will not know whether those Boards and Bureaus remaining should receive refunds until after the cost-benefit analysis is completed",0.0

Five, I'd like to now turn to the Committee's question regarding the availability of Enforcement Reports and whether Boards have been given all the tools they need to extract the reports. The Enforcement Performance Measure's Reports is available to the Boards and has been",0.0
False,,"since November of last year. The data is there and available to use. However, some of our Boards express specific concerns regarding a limited number of data points on that report. Given that, we have taken proactive steps to address and resolve their concerns. For example, we have convened a user group",0.0
False,,comprised of staff and boards from the Boards and Bureaus who designed and developed improved Enforcement Reports to better meet their needs. These changes will be incorporated into BreEZe by the end of the fiscal year. The reporting tools currently available to the Boards include the ability,0.0

For more complex reporting needs, the Department has made its IT staff available to provide ad-hoc data sets to Boards upon request. These ad-hoc data sets request help address the immediate reporting needs",0.0
False,,"until the enhanced Enforcement Reports are available this spring. Finally, the Committees have asked how BreEze's enforcement functions are working, whether they are working better than Licensing, and if so, why? BreEZE is meeting the operational day-to-day needs of the Boards in the first release",0.0
False,,and is continuing to improve its functionality. Several enchancements are under way including the Enforcement Reports that I just spoke of which will improve its performance. The enforcement functionality is much easier to design than licensing functionality. That is because enforcement processes are similar,0.0
False,,"across all DCA's Boards and Bureaus, and are more conducive to standardization. With this, Chairman, this concludes my testimony regarding BreEZe. We'll provide written testimony regarding the other issues identified by the Committees in the background document. Again, Mister Chairman, Madam Chair,",0.0
False,,thank you for the opportunity to give these comments and I look forward to questions that these bodies may have.,0.0
False,,"The performance from Accenture on other contracts I can't speak to, I can only speak to the constraints that the current contract gave me to implement the very lessons learned that Caltech, Department of Finance, and my department extracted after release one. In order to really make those changes,",0.0
False,,"the current contract construct precluded me from implementing all of that. We realized that the current contract was not sustainable because we could not control costs or scope and it was completely unsustainable as we started getting into what the 19 remaining Boards,",0.0
False,,"some very complex, some very small, had in store. There was missing functionality from the original contract that we knew we would have to bake in and pay for, so that was part of the thought process.",0.0
False,,"It would be...That is premature to say it will be Accenture. The whole reason why the State is requesting to own the license to this code base, so we can be much more agile, have the code base, and then figure out what we need and then let the vendor, whether it's Accenture or somebody else, give us the best bid on how to integrate",0.0
False,,into our code base that we then own the license to.,0.0
False,,"Well, I would say the confidence should be drawn from the very action that the State has taken, thus far, which was quickly address the problems in the middle of testing, prioritize the solutions which is the very amendment that the Auditor spoke of, getting the Boards in release one the necessary fixes they need at a quicker rate.",0.0
False,,That is the amendment that we spoke of. The second part of that is the much larger amendment that is in question which is cutting off the contractual relationship to the third phase. The State would be remiss to continue on the current contract and continue racking up costs and putting my Boards and Bureaus fund conditions in jeopardy.,0.0
False,,"So although, it is a completely undesirable position that we're in given the current contract construct, what has happened, the best course of action is to pause, figure out a better course of action on how to implement the remaining Boards.",0.0
False,,"The testing phase was definitely a time when we explored all of our options with Caltech. The option to terminate, the option to cure, and the option to go forward and use the contract to the best of our abilities were the three scenarios that we were given. The unfortunate circumstance was that Accenture, because of the conditions",0.0
False,,"and the requirements in the contract, Accenture was able to meet the contractual requirements. The problem was those contractual requirements did not meet the needs of our business. That is exactly why we had an 11 month testing window when our Boards in the first release pretty much redesigned the system. So, I'm not gonna speak for",0.0

False,,"and Mr. Ramos was successful in getting a price, not a cost, which is completely different, a price per day, or price per month, towards the state, until the end of March, I believe. The reason why I wanna draw your attention on cost versus price is, price is negotiated, cost is the direct cost that the vendor is incurring. And those are two different things.",0.0
False,,"We actually have that. We have the hourly breakdown of how much per person, per hour, it costs for them to be at DCA.",0.0
False,,The price is approximately 1. ... 2. ... 1.2 per month. The price for the delay is around 2.5 million.,0.0
False,,Sure.,0.0
False,,"Absolutely the culture has changed. You know, we're not, we're not making knee jerk reactions with regard to any decisions that have been made. The cost that we put out there with regard, it was worst case scenario. It was in the event that Accenture decided--",0.0
False,,"The worst case scenario we plan for in the event that the vendor, we had to know exactly what our liability would be in the event the vendor did not want to negotiate with the state. I needed that information in order to see what the state's exposure, both financial and programmatic, would be.",0.0
False,,"That's where that number came from. Now that my colleague has been successful in negotiating with the vendor, we have a different number that is just tagged to that month. The end of March, that's when the number runs out. So the numbers are different, but it's different context. In terms of the culture,",0.0
False,,"I would submit to this body that everything that we have done since we have found the problems has been very deliberate, and we have done everything with the state's best interest in mind. Lessons learned from release one, giving the boards and bureaus the additional time they need in design, testing, more maintenance.",0.0
False,,We've listened to them and we've engaged all of our control agencies on how we proceed.,0.0
False,,What our costs are?,0.0
False,,"The cost for the project is captured in Special Project Report 3.1. It's the cost of the project and how much is costs to run the project, inclusive of all the boards and bureaus that are part of that project.",0.0
False,,- My colleague brought up a very good point which is something we realized. Even before the testing phase in release one which is very far back.,0.0
False,,Expecting boards and bureaus to understand what they need to change in their own internal operation to meet a new system that they have never seen before and has problems with requirements was unfair at best.,0.0
False,,So one of the largest lessons learned in addition to the design methodology that we've improved has been a changed management contract.,0.0
False,,It is absolutely essential as we're taking boards and bureaus who are on pretty much a green screen system into a brand new web-based system that's mouse based and we need to walk them through where in their business process they can change glean efficiencies.,0.0
False,,Maybe they don't need to print reports. Maybe they don't need to print and make a file. It can be digitized.,0.0
False,,So I want to underscore what my colleague just said with regard to that.,0.0
False,,"- So that cost that you speak of is in SPR3.1. The cost of the project inclusive of release one, release two, and ending there is just short of 96 million. I believe it's 95.4 million dollars.",0.0
False,,"- No, the 86 million for termination would be essentially that, in the event we had to terminate and go into a cost scenario, that's what the financial and programmatic exposure would be to the State. That is a separate cost analysis that we did.",0.0
False,,"- No, it's not. It's either, or.",0.0
False,,- You're welcome.,0.0
False,,"- If I could Mister Chairman, absolutely after the cost-benefit analysis is conducted and we look at various ways of how to integrate, there will be costs associated with that, however, the way we are seeking to position ourselves is to directly mitigate costs.",0.0
False,,"There could be some programs that we can integrate with internal staff. Smaller boards, less configuration problems, very little risk associated with data conversion.",0.0
False,,You juxtapose that to Contractor's Board which may require additional support and everything in between. So the way the State is seeking to position itself is to directly mitigate that risk and not get into the position that we're in currently.,0.0
False,,"- [Kidane] I appreciate that comment, because that is exactly what we're doing or what leads to. Change management is absolutely crucial. That's where my department fell down.",0.0
False,,With not incorporating change management in conjunction with the rollover of a major IT project.,0.0
False,,"The second is the proximity of training, which is robust. We have a lot of curriculum, but the proximity of the training to the actual roll out, and that's where we missed the mark on that one.",0.0
False,,"It's like preparing for a game. If you train for the game too far away from the actual game, all of that training is for naught. So what we're doing is, as if the schedule of the release moves, so does the training.",0.0
False,,We did not do that with the first release. So those two components will help the human aspect and the culture aspect of this release two as well as giving us enough forethought for what we do with the remaining clients in release three.,0.0
False,,"[Kidane] If I could buttress up what my colleague said, specifically to my department. Those milestones are absolutely vital to the health and safety of this project or I would submit, any project.",0.0
False,,"Specifically to Breeze, what we learned as I stated, the original problem was the contract and the anemic requirements in that contract that led into not enough time in testing, a design that was based on those initial requirements.",0.0
False,,Therefore we needed 11 months in the testing phase. All of those issues have been remedied in the amendment that we're speaking of We have a rigorous design process that my boards and bureau in release two have enjoyed.,0.0
False,,Very detailed methodology that went into their design. We have more time and quality controls even before the boards go to the testing phase.,0.0
False,,The department will run tests independently of the boards to make sure that what we ask for is essentially there.,0.0
False,,"We also have more time in testing for end-to-end testing So, what I'm saying essentially, the milestones that you accurately point out, we have baked into this new contract as lessons learned.",0.0
False,,"- Yes. I want to qualify the answer in that yes, there was no baseline design. The auditor is absolutely correct.",0.0
False,,"There was not, what we have now, which is here is what the state is asking for, therefore please develop scripts and test against this and see if it passes. We did not have that.",0.0
False,,"The fluctuations in design that was evident to everybody was because during the testing phase, the product did not meet the business needs of the boards and bureaus.",0.0
False,,"So, the irony is, we did not have a baseline design, therefore, we could make fluctuations in that product without the state being charged.",0.0
False,,"We did not have a contractual baseline therefore you saw wild fluctuations in the design to better meet the business need. The problem in that is, you're defeating the very purpose of what a testing phase is.",0.0
False,,"A testing phase is, you're supposed to have a set parameters of a design and you test against that, and you simply say ""does it work or doesn't it work"".",0.0
False,,"If it does not work, you have provisions in the contract to hold the vendor accountable. So, that's the only difference that I see in what happened.",0.0
False,,- The per month price from Accenture is around 1.2 million. What happens after March is predicated on conversations that Director Ramos has with the vendor in the event we need more time.,0.0
False,,"- No no no no, more time. I'm sorry, I thought the question was in the context of the delayed section 11, etc.",0.0
False,,Absolutely. So if there is more time needed past the end of March then the price of that is predicated on what the conversations that CalTech Director Ramos has with the vendor.,0.0
False,,"Similar to what has happened thus far, going from the February 27th to where we are now, will be similar to that.",0.0
False,,"- Awet Kidane, Director for the Department of Consumer Affairs.",0.0
False,,"- Thank you Mr. Chairman, Madame Chair. Before we start today and discuss the Consumer Protection Enforcement Initiative, I really want to reiterate my own personal commitment and the commitment of the department to ensure that we have the most efficient disciplinary process possible.",0.0
False,,"As I mentioned earlier, Consumer Protection is the department's mandate, we cannot go back to the days before CPEI, when an average of three years to take disciplinary action was considered good enough.",0.0
False,,That is wholesale unacceptable to me. We look forward to a continued partnership with this committee and with the rest of the legislature as we continue our efforts.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Gomez here, my Deputy Director for Enforcement, has been working diligently to keep our efforts on the right track, and with that, I would gladly like to turn it over to him.",0.0
False,,"- I do wanna underscore what Mr. Gomez said. The reports issue that I previously spoke of gave Mr. Gomez a opportunity to create some standardization across a lot of the boards, and that.",0.0
False,,"In order for the metrics to really mean something, we have to understand, we need to make sure we're counting an orange and an orange and an apple and an apple.",0.0
False,,"So to Mr. Gomez's credit, he and the user groups were heavily engaged in developing what those standards are and what they count for, that way as we measure ourselves, we understand what the metrics mean, and we then hold ourselves accountable.",0.0
False,,"- [Awet Kidane] Mr. Chairman. What my colleague said is absolutely correct regarding the metrics, use of the metrics, and the vision of CPEI and how it is just as, if not more important, where we are now.",0.0
False,,"However, we are developing the means to completely revamp it using data.",0.0
False,,"What metrics actually mean to each of the boards, and to make sure those metrics are meaningful and something that not only we can defend, but is based in fact. As we do that, we'll keep this body informed of where we are through that process.",0.0
False,,"Thank you. Sharon Rapport with the Corporation for Supportive Housing. Under Bringing Families Home, the Department of Social Services would select counties to participate in the grant program.",0.0
False,,"And though both, as Mr. Bauters mentioned, both the child welfare system and the homeless systems intersect, they're not aligned in addressing the challenges the families face.",0.0
False,,So some of the funding would go toward funding county positions for liaison to break down the silos between these two systems.,0.0
False,,The bulk of the funding though would go for housing interventions. Counties currently are developing or already have in place systems to assess a family's housing needs if they're homeless. And the bulk of the funding would go for getting the right housing interventions for these families.,0.0
False,,"It would fund things like housing location assistance, services that promote housing stability, and rental subsidies for three months to five years, depending on the needs of the families.",0.0
False,,"Counties would match the funding dollar for dollar, so they would be leveraging local and federal funding for this program, and we estimate that this funding, this $10 million combined with the local funding, would serve between 400 and 600 families. We know, based on evidence, that getting these families into housing not only ends their episodes of homelessness but also prevents foster care placement and reunifies families more quickly and that there are fewer incidents of recurrence of maltreatment or the problems that led to foster care placement.",0.0
False,,They also promote employment and educational opportunities as well as health stability. So we ask for your support for this budget item. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Jeff Vaca representing the California Association of School Business Officials in support of the bill.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and Members, Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association. CTA is in support of Assembly Bill 753.  In a county office, if a school district does not have a need for these education professionals in the coming year, they should utilize the lay-off process just as larger districts do.",0.0
False,,"For this small community of employees, to deny them permanent status, is hurting our students, especially those who are most in need of consistency. I do want to defer my time to an educator who is directly impacted here and we hope you'll support this proposal.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, Nancy Chaires Espinoza with the California School Boards Association. We also had an opposed unless amended on this bill, but we appreciate the amendments the author has agreed to take and will be reevaluating our position once we see those in print.",0.0

False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association. If I was going to seek a ways to eliminate charter schools in California without simply going to the California Charter Schools Act and repealing it, I might choose an approach like AB 787.",0.0
False,,"And that may sound like hyperbole, but let me explain why that is not hyperbolic. Talking about 1,184 charter schools in the State of California, who in one fell swoop, when 787 is adopted, if it's adopted, would be required to have their boards of directors appointed by their school district authorizer.",0.0
False,,"We understand the law is written to create in the petition process, an opportunity for the charter school to nominate the members of the board, and that the school district would then select from that list. But let's be honest with each other, there is a lot of negotiation that occurs in the petition process.",0.0
False,,"There are things that school disctricts put forward to the charter school that have basically said, if you want us to approve your petition, we want you to do these things. There are school disctricts, I guarantee, today, that, if this was the law, would say, if you give us 10 names, or 20 names, that we agree with, then we'll approve your petition.",0.0
False,,"But if you don't, then it'll be rejected. Those things are happening today on other petition elements, and would happen, I'm sure, in some cases, not all, but in some cases would happen with this new petition element. So it's very troubling to us that the autonomy and the independence that characterizes the charter school movement in California could be effectively wiped out by this bill.",0.0
False,,"The proponents and the author have suggested there are substantive reasons why this bill needs to be enacted. I heard the representative from the California Labor Federation, which I appreciated, talking about a lot of great charters, and also talking about some bad actors.",0.0
False,,"We know that's the case as well. But in advocating for this bill, what they have not done, is say why the board composition problem is the problem. And why it needs to be fixed. They raised the issue of CAVA. So CAVA is a single charter school, or 11, depending on your perspective, out of 1,184, that is having a dispute over the question of organizing its teachers.",0.0
False,,"A question that is currently before PERB. PERB has not acted yet. They have had hearings, but decisions are expected in the next few weeks. We don't anticipate that those decisions have anything to do with this bill, nor do we suspect that PERB is going to undermine the very explicit law that currently says the Education Employment Rights Act applies to all charter school employees.",0.0
False,,"So rather than suggesting that PERB is going to create a crisis, why don't we wait and see what PERB says, and if there is a problem, let's all sit down and figure out what that appropriate solution is. They've also raised the spectrum of the National Labor Relations Board.",0.0
False,,"There is an opinion issued by NLRB for California, for California charter school teachers that dates back to 2006, and is still the opinion in California, that California charter school employees are governed by EERA. They are not governed by NLRB.",0.0
False,,"They will point to a Chicago case, in which NLRB found differently, that case was vacated by the US Supreme Court, it was dismissed by NLRB, and has never been re-filed. It's never been re-submitted. That case no longer exists, it technically does not exist. So pointing to that case, and claiming that that's the reason why NLRB is poised to jump into California and make all charter schools private makes absolutely no sense.",0.0
False,,"And last argument that's been raised, not so much at this table today, but certainly in the analysis, is the reason why AB 1531was introduced last year. And that was to deal with a crisis between IRS and PERBS. I don't want to get into the details because that issue was resolved.",0.0
False,,"And resolved in favor of charter schools and their teachers. And PERBS is already working in the two months since that decision was handed down, working to make sure that all charter schools that applied to be in PERBS, will be allowed to be in PERBS, and those that were denied, nine or 10 from last year, will be back in.",0.0
False,,"We are very comfortable with the IRS decision, the IRS is very comfortable with it, and PERBS is very comfortable with it and has communicated that explicitly to this committee. So there are three reasons given, none of which have any foundation in terms of crisis or urgency that needs to be handled by this bill.",0.0
False,,"And I would simply point out, two things, finally. One is that changing the board structure has absolutely nothing to do with EERA it has nothing to do with CAVA, it has nothing to do with NLRB, and it has nothing to do with PERBS. It has a lot to do with the independence and the autonomy of charter schools, and what makes charter schools unique.",0.0
False,,"And yeah, we can have boards appointed by the school district, but at that point, they might as well just become district schools, which is what some charter schools are. They are still governed by the board.",0.0
False,,"I also want to just say, with some sympathy, to the teachers who testified, I mean, we hear problems like that, and you're not the only school that has problems like that.",0.0
False,,"But the big question is, where's the school district authorizer in that case? Why is the school district not stepping in, and saying, ""Why are you not hiring clerical staff?"" Why are you not doing the things that are necessary, and the things that you said in your petition that you were going to do?",0.0
False,,"That's the responsibility of the school district to do, and not the responsibility of a law change like this, in order to accomplish that. So for those reasons, I would ask for your opposition of this bill.",0.0
False,,I do have some things that -- we're going to have some folks just do me too's. But they do have written testimony if I could ask the Chair's indulgence to ask the Sargeant to distribute these so you can --,0.0
False,,We got some me too's as well.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, members, Nancy Chaires Espinosa, on behalf of the California School Boards Association. We must respectfully oppose this bill. The issue in question has a solution. It has multiple solutions under existing law. First, if the boundaries of the school districts don't meet the needs of the people that they serve, they can reorganize",0.0
False,,"those boundaries within existing law, and of course, there is the existing inter-district transfer process, which as the author mentioned, in most of these cases has already been granted. So, people who live here are not forced to quote borrow addresses. The issue does in fact have a solution, which, as evidenced by the testimony given,",0.0
False,,"has been working in favor of most of the people who have requested it. There are some more, some broader, more troubling issues here. This bill would impose upon the ability of the districts to plan for successive years. It would effectively be a mandatory open enrollment, so without being able to reliably project their attendance in out years,",0.0
False,,"they wouldn't be able to reliably plan for facilities, staffing, and all of those various issues. Further, this bill would set a troubling precedent by saying that the authority of a local educational agency would have to take second place in comparison to other parts of the local government system, specifically here in municipal government.",0.0
False,,"And, we really think that it would be inappropriate for the Legislature to presuppose what these decisions should be. The district has been making those on a case by case basis. So, we respectfully request your opposition to this measure.",0.0

False,,"On the topic of shifting child care into the Proposition 98 guarantee, the coalition has had many robust conversations about this topic this year. Historically, we have opposed shifting non Proposition 98 programs to being included within the guarantee.",0.0
False,,"We maintain that position this year. We hope that's not interpreted as a value statement about the importance of adequately funding childcare, but rather a statement of concern that over time as those cost increase within the Prop 98 guarantee that it will impact the ability of local education agencies to provide academic programs that allow California's students to achieve the goals for students and achievement that we all hope for them. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Kevin Aslanian, Coalition of California Welfare Rights Organizations. We also support putting the money into, taking out of Prop 98. And we also want to remind the committee that CalWORKs recipients are still living under 21 or 31% of the poverty level.",0.0

In talking with a lot of folks in my agriculture community, people have put a lot of time and effort into trying to figure out how this works.

False,,Sawait Seyoum on behalf of Health Access California in support.,0.0
False,,"Yes, I'd like to make a few comments and I'll be very brief. As chair of the California legislative black caucus, this has become a number one priority for us. And what has been interesting and I'll just pick up on this one point about diversity of ideas, being able to talk honestly with one another. To look at ourselves critically about where we are, but most important where we wanna go into the future.",0.0
False,,"And we even talked about body cameras and the court system, we can get into those. But the reason that I'm here now, why I got on this committee, because I still believe that change is gonna have to come from within the ranks of the rank and the file at the end of the day. You're gonna have to change the way you police in ways that during the 60s, it was dogs and fire hoses and a whole bunch of other atrocities that were done.",0.0
False,,"That was standard policing policy and then you evolved. Policing evolved and you got better. But I think it was because of that struggle between people having this dialogue was the best way to proceed and within the black caucus, what's been great is we do have these same kinda debates and we kind of side on more or less to the left. We need to do this. We need to have this kinda regulation. It is always interesting, which I find, actually I enjoy.",0.0
False,,"You'll see one or two hands go up or two or three members will call me and say, you know what? I used to be a police officer in a local police department. I used to be, I'm a reserve sheriff or I've had 25 years in the sheriff department. I see things just a little different than what you're looking at and I think that's very, very, very healthy. In fact, I think if we come together more and the black officers and come up with ideas, we may ultimately come up with solutions. Because now, we're interacting with actual public safety professionals to come up with remedies for what is going on. We need to have this kind of interaction, because at the end of the day, as you probably have now figured out.",0.0
False,,"Unlike Dr. Weber, I wanted to be elected official, because I thought the ones that I work for in the city of LA, I could have done a dam much better job than they could. And so I'm sitting there going, wait a minute. I need to get elected to fix this stuff and you don't want elected officials telling you what to do. If you don't want that to happen, then you gotta clean up your own house.",0.0
False,,"The reason we jump in, the reason we have these laws that you sit back and go why are you doing this, because you're not helping. And if you leave us up, just like your kids. If you leave them up to their own devices, you see what you're gonna get. And so I implore you to use this committee and other examples to come up with ideas. And I'll just leave you with this, even with body cameras, even just the idea of looking at the video before or after.",0.0
False,,"If you stand back and say, the public, forget about us elected officials, the public is concerned that the 1% might compromise that video, so that you can get away with murder. Not get away with something wrong, but literally get away with murder. And so when you come back to us and say, you know what? We can make our reports better, what we hear, the public, they hear, oh, you plan to cheat on a test, because you got a chance to look at the answers beforehand and you plan to cheat to make it better.",0.0
False,,"And so I'm gonna push it back to you to say, how do you keep that 1% from compromising something that might be a very good idea, which is body cameras. How do you plan to protect as a chief of the department? How do you plan to ensure that you get accurate information and you can use this as a tool for training, you can use this as a way to weed out the 1%, tell us.",0.0
False,,"If you remain silent and just say no, then we can't move, we can't even dialogue, if you're not giving us some response. And so what I'm imploring you to do, as we come up with these ideas, I would recommend you come up with the ideas of how to change and put some legislation in to make the system better, so that you can get rid of the 1% that is damaging your whole profession.",0.0
False,,"And I think you'll get a response, not only just from us, but most importantly, the public. There's a huge image problem right now and the best way to do that is to be proactive in making changes. And so again, I wanna thank Assemblymember Cooper for bringing you here, so we can continue this dialog. I think is ultimately at the end of the day, that's how we're gonna come up with the best answers. And the last thing I would tell you, the best answers I've gotten, I've said this in other committees, have come from law enforcement, especially African American law enforcement.",0.0
False,,"So this whole issue of diversity is really great. And in the corrections department, I've met with African-American correctional officers who have said, we have to change the culture.

False,,"We've got to come up with more holistic way of dealing with this, so these guys don't come back. How do we ensure that they don't come back? And if it means changing the way you're trained, if it means then going back again to your culture and you have officers that think beyond kind of the Dirty Harry kind of approach.

It's for local entities to draw down on those monies, so it'll be able to better help those who are most needed.",0.0
False,,"The thing that I'm most happy about it is the Governor's proposal for an 18 month amnesty, mainly because it sets the stage for the courts to go after about $10.6 billion in uncollected revenue. If this program has any success whatsoever trying to obtain about $150 million, what would it be like if we only got 10% of that 10.6 billion. We probably could help close the gap of the reductions that they've taken over several years. And so we will continue to work, not only with the Governor's office, but also look at other ways to get those unclaimed resources.",0.0
False,,"The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the other good news is the numbers have reduced. We're about 40,000 beds reduction, which means there's a reduction about $73.3 million to the CDCR.",0.0

We have people as far as Mississippi and Texas were housing prisoners, we need to bring them back home, once we get our numbers down. We need to do it cautiously. And, one day we may even be able to even close a prison, which has been unprecedented and never been done before. And I believe there's some talk about that.",0.0

They're currently working on innovative programming outside of prisons. There's another 1.5 million in support of work force investment boards. They're the ones that actually find jobs for the formerly incarcerated, and they've been doing a phenomenal job at that. As we all know, once you get out or prison, if you're not able to work, you're not able to find housing, you're not able to get re-acclimated to society, you go back to what got you in prison in the first place. The WIB board are excellent tool in ensuring that they get some type of employment.",0.0

As many of us have been working on on our committee, one of the biggest problem that we right now have is human trafficking, it's taking us over like a tsunami. We need to provide, not only resources, but we have to provide resources in a unique way.

False,,"Those locals who actually those communities that actually want to go out and do it on their own, I think we have a duty to provide them some kind of funding so they can at least get it off the ground, maybe even do their own pilot programs, and so, we're starting with $5 million to help with that effort, and I thank you.",0.0
False,,And I thank you.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, and just so you know, we heard from the chiefs and part of the challenge that both the Senate, and I will also say the assembly has, when asked how are these resources being used to help with the 109 and most importantly as we go into Prop 47, we really didn't get any definitive answers from law enforcement on that.",0.0
False,,"But just going with that, the senate totally eliminated it. The governor's office want to give them 40 million. The question is whether or not we have some type of accountability. Whether or not these strings are unattached.",0.0
False,,"After listening to Mr. Cooper and members from my committee, I felt it prudent to strike some kind of compromise. And so there is $20 million that has absolutely no strings on it. It's still problemental for me and several members of both the Senate and the Assembly on how it's being spent.",0.0
False,,"So what you see from the Senate, they're actually putting in what they think the money should be spent on, specifically. At least when it goes to conference committee and this is what I would suggest to the police chiefs, that you make very transparent what these moneys are being spent on and how it actually will help with the 109s and the realignment because I think that's what is needed when it gets to conference.",0.0
False,,"Right now, if you wanna look at it, I guess the police chiefs looks at it as half empty, I look at it as half full. And so depending on your perspective, the Assembly is probably taking the high road and is looking at it, starting to phase it to where it can actually be used for 109s.",0.0
False,,"And if they can come back as we go to conference and make a good compelling case for how this money is specifically being used to help with the 109s, I think once it gets to conference, you may get a better result then definitely on the Senate side.",0.0
False,,"The only discussion we had about cameras in cars was based on body cameras, being able to coordinate the two. Right now there are a lot of departments that already have implemented some type of cameras within their vehicles. So then the next question begs the question of how do you coordinate a body camera with the car, and that's one of the things that the CHP will be looking at. For example, all CHP officers' cars have some type of camera recording device.",0.0
False,,"Once an officer's out, how do we then connect that, so you get a panoramic view of what's going on? But we did not receive any requests. No department came to us to say, look, we also need to put more cameras on our vehicles. That wasn't anything that was requested by any law enforcement or even the public.

False,,"You can put just about anything in a local control accountability plan and so we're far from being there, that's a very wide kind of you can deviate from seniority for just about anything kind of a proposal.",0.0

False,,"But as I thought about what you were asking Senator Jackson, I thought a couple of things. One is that it is really hard to task just one agency or one program with that answer for those outcomes.",0.0
False,,"Because, as I think about the conversations that have happened on the first panel and, here about CalWorks, for example, you asked a really good question of the first panelists. How do we get the employment specialists who work with our CalWorks families to think differently about how we help them?",0.0
False,,"And I think part of that is on the way, in the sense that we are working toward this more broad based assessment tool.

False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, Jenny Bellow with the analyst's office. As your agenda indicates, both the Senate and Assembly's packages included some new funding for the State Long Term Care Ombudsman Program.

False,,The difference here is really that the assembly also provided 5 million general fund for the Long Term Care Ombudsman Program and we checked in with the department to give you a little context on sort of how that would translate. They estimate that they could hire roughly 85 new staff at the local level to provide these services.,0.0
False,,"And those staff would also be able to leverage hundreds of volunteers for the Long Term Care Ombudsman Program. They'd be doing more complaint investigations, but also more upfront monitoring of the facilities. And just one other note is this would be the first general fund that this program received since it was last cut in 2007-8.",0.0

False,,Thank you Mr. Chair. Jenny Bellow with the Analyst's Office. What you have in front of you here is an assembly proposal to make changes to the Case Management and Payrolling System for the In-Home Supportive Services Program.,0.0
False,,"As part of the coordinated care initiative several years ago, as you're aware, the In-Home Supportive Services Program became a managed care benefit in certain counties and the legislation that implemented the Coordinated Care Initiative allowed the managed care plans to augment In-Home Supportive Services hours on their own dime.",0.0
False,,If they decided that they wanted to provide more services for someone in their own home the issue really here is that they have been wanting to use the CMIPS II system or the Payrolling and IT system for In-Home Supportive Services to be able to track and pay for those hours and to also allow the recipients to use the same provider for those hours.,0.0
False,,So this change would facilitate that it would allow the managed care plans to utilize the system for those extra hours in line with legislative intent.,0.0
False,,"I think the administration may have an updated estimate of what they believe the actual cost is, but I think the total fund estimate of 7 million is reasonable. It may be an issue over breakout between general fund and federal funds being more of an 50/50 split. They could probably verify that.",0.0
False,,"I think just one other note that I would make for just context is all of the In-Home Supportive Services issues that you're considering today have implications for the same IT system, and so it may be something that as you land on these various issues, you direct the administration and let them know what your priorities are in terms of the ordering and the sequencing of these types of events.",0.0

False,,"Another 20 million for the Transitional Housing Plus program. And that's an existing program. It's currently in 46 counties, so this would be an additional 20 million for that effort.

False,,"That would put up funding for counties that were interested in matching that funding, and providing housing supports for child welfare service involved families. And they also provided 3.25 million for the Federal Strengthening Families Act.",0.0

False,,"I have a hand out, if you're interested. So you can see the assembly provided a one time COLA to the SSP portion of the combined SSP grant that would be effective January 1, 2016. The cost in the budget year is estimated to be 33 million and that annualizes to about 66 million on an ongoing basis.",0.0
False,,"As the handout shows you, it walks you through sort of what would happen to the maximum SSI SSP grant under the assembly's action and you can see that the grant for individuals would increase by $4 while the grant for couples would increase by $10.",0.0
False,,"One thing to note here is that both for couples and for individuals currently, the SSP portion of the grant is at the minimum level allowable by federal law and going below that would actually mean we sacrifice all of our Medicaid funding. So that's where we are at now.",0.0
False,,"The last state funded COLA for the SSI SSP grant was in April of 2005, similar to the CALWORKS COLA item you discussed earlier, the automatic COLAs or the statutory COLA were eliminated in 2009.",0.0

False,,"So we will continue to work with the author, but at this time our position is still opposed. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"No we would actually agree with the sponsors characterization, it's not common to include these clauses in a contract and the reason for that is because we, as a project owner, can recover those costs whether or not we include that clause in the contract.

False,,"One of our concerns is that including those clauses and, in concert with this proposed language, it may muddy the waters. It may cause some confusion.",0.0
False,,"So perhaps a judge could say, you as the owner were able to recover these consequential damages, per statute, or per custom. But, unfortunately, you have voluntarily capped yourself, so that might lead to some confusion and that's something we would like to avoid.",0.0

False,,"You'll see that as Ms. Grove pointed out, one rate increased 2006-07 was the only rate increase that the legislature and governor have given in the last 12 state budgets to this community. Meanwhile, the cost of living went up 30% during that time period.",0.0
False,,"So where does the money come from?

False,,Madam Chair. I do note that in the analysis it indicates that the previous governors have vetoed legislation like this. I wonder if the author to explain whether this bill is different and whether it's responsive to any of the concerns that have been raised as a part of previous measures?,0.0
False,,"I think that part of the challenge that we've had with previous Executive Governors, where they don't want any undue burden on the courts and we will work with the court to ensure that this doesn't become either financial or an undue burden, lengthening court cases.",0.0
False,,"And then the more I'd look into this and I'd like to thank the NRA for coming because that's one issue I didn't even think about, people losing their right to own or bear a firearm if you accept a felony plea and so there's a whole list, cacophony of different voices, that could come in here and tell you about what could be on this list.",0.0
False,,"We have to figure out a way to let people know that and I think that, from the executive branch. I think we can show that it will not be an undue financial or exhaustive burden on the courts, especially if we just list it and have maybe someone sign off on it, but we do need to have some kind of consultation with the defendant to do that.",0.0
False,,So there's nothing in what you're proposing that's substantially different than what's been proposed in previous years then?,0.0
False,,"I'm not absolutely sure, but I can find out for sure and then get back to you. Okay?",0.0
False,,"That'd be great and then you did raise another option because I'm concerned about the broadness of this list and obviously we want a defendant to be aware of the consequences, there's no question about that.",0.0
False,,"But you just brought up another alternative which seems more attractive to me, which is to be able to present to the defendant a list as defined that allows them to sign off on it. So the court and everyone can be clear on that. That would seem to put less of a burden on the courts and more on the defense council to have reviewed that list.",0.0
False,,"Almost as if you were revealing a contract in a real estate transaction so that they could be clear about those consequences and then have a sign-off. So, that certainly seems a lot more attractive to me. That would seem to advance the worthy goals that you have put forward.",0.0
False,,But allows the court and everyone to be clear that the defendant is understanding the consequences. That is something that you would consider?,0.0
False,,"Yes and Senator Glazer, I'm trying to get this worthy goal done. I don't want the bureaucracy to weigh it down. So, as a former bureaucrat, I'm dedicated to ensuring that that doesn't happen.",0.0
False,,"So, for me and I'm new to this process, I'm comfortable with the bill as presented, but I think if there was a way to provide that same protection to the defendant with some sort of a check-off would seem to me something that I would encourage.",0.0
False,,"Part of this is that we don't and I know we're not supposed to go back and forth, but part of this is, with the governor I think is he likes for, the administration likes for the departments to come up with their own methodology.",0.0
False,,"I think once the courts embrace this, and they know that they need to do this, I think they will come up with a way to get this done where it doesn't impact them adversely. That's just one idea off the top of my head right here.",0.0
False,,"I see but Madam Chair, it does seem like we're directing the judge to take some specific action. Does that leave leniency to the judicial council as to how they implement it and would they be allowed to in the implementation of this bill as written, allow for a check-off to be worked out through their defense council?",0.0
False,,"I think, for me at least, this is going in the right direction. I don't know if it's appropriate to hear from the judicial council as to how they would interpret the bill as written or an amendment as suggested in terms of their ability to.",0.0
False,,Yes.,0.0
False,,"Well, Madame Chair, can I ask a more specific question? As I understand the bill, it says it requires the court to inform. So I'm not as aware of how that is traditionally done within the law. So, does it allow the court to inform through a check-off that's submitted to the defense counsel? Is that an option that the court would have?",0.0
False,,"So, Madam Chair, then to the Chair. The criticism was cost and if we're hearing that that somehow is avoidable, that adds more confusion, to me, at least. If we're trying to, again, the worthy goals of informing the defendant, but trying to avoid the costs, I'm not still clear about how we reconcile all that.",0.0

So this is why we came to this conclusion, so the five member or seven member police commission comes up with a determination that. The rest of us keep shaking our heads at how could you come up with that determination.",0.0
False,,"And it's very important, like this bill is, to kinda open it up so that we have an understanding of the process, and how are these determinations made. And I'm gonna allow Judge Cordell to kinda finish her discussion, or her answer to the PC 938.1 question.",0.0

There's a lot about the grand jury that we don't know about and how they work and operate and I think this is very important.

False,,"And so while you move through this on a policy level, hopefully you're looking in the corner of your eye to make sure we also can have the money there to afford it, because the last thing you want to happen is, as we all know, we go through this whole process, and we get to the financial part, and then it dies.

False,,"I read in analysis they said something about bias crimes as opposed to using the word hate crimes, and whether it fits in this. I also thought about the meter officer, the traffic officers, that gets into an argument, I started to think about the TSA officer that have been killed because of their profession.",0.0

We urge your support.",0.0
False,,"Good morning Madam Chair, Members. Good to be with you again. This is Nancy Chaires-Espinosa with the California School Board Association. I am going to attempt to have a little bit more of a fact based conversation. We've heard some really emotional language, and I will begin by pointing you to the committee zone analysis of the bill, the statement for the need of the bill.",0.0
False,,"If you look just at the facts, even in what some of us may consider the worst case scenario of applying this statute, the process worked. The district conducted an investigation. It came to a decision. It shared that information with the family. It stood corrected. It changed its decision and ultimately made the right decision. But what I think is really critical here is that we broaden our context.",0.0
False,,"This bill would not just affect the situation that brought this issue to light for the author. It would affect the entire state, so let's please consider this bill with that in mind. The typical situation is very different from the one that we've seen in Orinda. It's much more sophisticated families who trigger these investigations. It's much more common that it be related to sports, that people want to get their students into the right district and the right school for purposes of getting athletic scholarships, things of that nature.",0.0
False,,"So, in the universe in which a school may need to conduct a residency investigation it's typically a very different situation than the one we've seen. So I just I just wanted to make sure that we all start with that frame of mind. So, current law defines pupil residency requirements and regulations actually require school districts to verify pupil residency every single year. So we've talked a lot about it, I think there's been again colorful language trying to get motivation to the district for conducting these residency investigations.",0.0
False,,"I want to make very clear, it's actually our responsibility to do that. There are a few provisions of the bill that are a problem for us. The provision requiring the board to adopt the specified policy, I don't think we have a concern with the fact of the board creating a specified policy to address this. It's really the specific requirements and the level of detail that it goes into. So specific, articulable facts, I think a lot of us learned a new word with articulable.",0.0
False,,"It's a little bit of a problem, and I'm scratching my head a little bit when some of my colleagues with CTA and CFT are in support of this bill. I fear that they have not thought through the implications of this. This language may require the district to identify the individuals, the district employees who may have triggered the investigation. So, by not allowing the district to conduct to protect confidentiality, that's a problem for anyone who may provide information to the district, be they a district employee, be they a community member.",0.0
False,,"Once the word is out in the community, that if you participate in this kind of investigation, if you give an honest answer to someone from the district who is coming to ask you question about a student's residency, that you're identity will not be protected. That spreads pretty quickly. So that will seriously impair our ability to gather honest information from people.",0.0
False,,"Second, the requirement that anyone who is conducting this type of investigation, be it the district employee or someone working on behalf of the district, divulge the fact of the investigation is a problem for us. There is a benefit when you're conducting an investigation. To being able to gather all of your facts and then sharing them with the family. The reason for that is that people may not be truthful with you.",0.0
False,,"So the family, the parents, members of the community, if it's an aunt or an uncle and we're borrowing their address to enroll in what we think is a better district. All of these people are very well intentioned, and if it's clear to them that it's in their hands to lie and do what they think is in the best interest of their student, they will commonly do that. When you put that together with the fact that the list of documents that statute specifies that districts have to use as evidence for residency are very easy to falsify. It's very easy to get fake address onto those legal documents. We are left with photographic evidence.",0.0
False,,"So this bill would actually prohibit us from using photography or video. So once the district goes through it's process, either sends a letter or sits down and has a in person meeting with the family, commonly the parents will stick to their story. They'll continue to say no, no, no. This is where we live, this is where Junior lives who lives with his aunt, whatever the story is. And it's only the photography, and the video, that allow everyone to come to a consensus about what the real situation is.",0.0
False,,"So absent this very critical investigative tool, we are effectively unable to verify student residency in these situations, as the law requires us to do. And you know we've talked a little bit, the author suggested an amendment to actually define what the word surreptitious is and I understand the analysis represents that the bill doesn't prohibit photography, that it prohibits surreptitious photography, which could be defined.",0.0
False,,"I think any kind of photography that we need for investigative purpose could be described as surreptitious, even with the propose definition. So what we need is photograph that shows a student going into a specified location. It's difficult to capture all of that information if you're standing, you know, five feet away. So ideally, we would have to be, maybe, across the street. Or across the street, you know, behind a bush apparently is a problem, but what about next to a bush.",0.0
False,,"According to the definition that is proposed here by the author, it's still unclear because, what's the right distance? Could you be two houses down? Could you be half a block away? What is the definition of surreptitious and what is the definition of covert according to the proposal? It would introduce, actually, a greater level of confusion, opening up our districts to liability and impeding our ability to do our job, to implement this code section.",0.0
False,,"So with that I understand the situation, I ask of you to please not assume that some of our, some of our, I guess worst case scenario stories are actually typical of what's happening across the state. Please bear in mind the good actors, which is everybody else who is trying to implement this law and don't impede our ability to do that. So we respectfully oppose.",0.0
False,,Who do I represent?,0.0
False,,California School Boards Association.,0.0
False,,"So, well first I want to clarify, hope I didn't say usually that they're dishonest, sometimes they're dishonest. It's handled in different ways, but generally the process is that something has triggered the reason to believe that the student doesn't meet the residency requirements, that could be maybe you have documents that have different addresses, maybe an individual can use some information, something like that.",0.0
False,,"So you'd gather whatever information that you have and depending on the circumstances, if I think the typical situation, like what happened in Orinda the way it would typically be handled is that someone would speak to the family. In this case, clearly as was stated, it was not handled well.",0.0
False,,"If there is a reason to believe that there is a more, I'd say, intentional deceit, like in the more typical situation with athletics, you would probably want to gather your photographic and video evidence before letting the family know that you have a concern. And the reason for that is because it's very important not to give people an opportunity to make temporary changes in their behavior that would keep you from getting an accurate picture of what's happening. But yes, typically you gather your information, you talk to the family and that's the point at which you will make a final decision.",0.0
False,,"Emphatically, no. It is not. And that's really the point I wanted to make, that we step back from the situation that happened in Orinda to really consider the way school districts operate across the state. No, it is never grounds to do that. If I may address your previous question. The issue of harm, whether there is any harm to students with conducting the photography.",0.0
False,,"So it sounds very benign to say photography would take place in open and public view. I am actually concerned that that would be harmful to students. That is much scarier for a young child to have an individual in open and public view taking pictures of them. Or if they're not able to take pictures of them, having to talk to them ask them questions when it's a grown up they don't know. The result of this bill will result in harm to students. Current law, which allows an adult to be at a safe distance where a child will not see them, avoids that harm.",0.0

False,,"we'll keep working on the other 118, but I think we can get there. Because you have a very active and strong advocate, and I'm a strong advocate for you also. And so, it may not have happened in the past. Just like we didn't fund the courts in the past, and they've gotten 100 million in my first budget, when I was budget chair, and 200 million the next year.",0.0

False,,"We have been working with the author and proponents to try to find that middle ground, to address the concerns which really go to the heart of what alternatives we can look to use going forward. And to the extent that we can address those concerns, our companies have agreed to not only remove the opposition but formally support the bill.",0.0
False,,The companies have already made that very firm commitment to move out of those polyethylene traditional plastic microbeads without question. And it had already agreed to do that long before any legislation had surfaced anywhere in the country.,0.0
False,,"But in terms of moving forward and looking at alternatives, some of the natural exfoliants that are available, walnut shells, sugars, and what have you, do not necessarily work for every particular application.",0.0
False,,"Particularly when you are looking at over the counter products with active ingredients, consumers who may have an allergy to some of those natural things, walnut shells and others. That's not to say that they're not good alternatives, certainly, but they just don't work, necessarily, in every application.",0.0
False,,"In terms of going forward, our concern with the bill as currently drafted relates to the definition of a plastic microbead. And the concern that the bill would ultimately ban some of those inventive new technologies that are being developed, that are commercially available today.",0.0
False,,"And importantly, you'll hear from another person to my right, from Micro Powders, about the fact that those commercially available alternatives are indeed biodegradable. They are tested by third party labs against OECD standards that are the most stringent standards relative to persistence and biodegration.",0.0
False,,"Further, they meet those guidelines. As part of moving forward in our really, I mean truly good faith effort to try to address the concerns, work with the author  and proponents, we've put forth well over 20 sets of different amendments on the definition of plastic microbead over the course of the last year and a half.",0.0
False,,"Really, truly in a good faith effort to try and find that middle ground. Our latest proposed amendments that you have all seen really were our effort to try and address some of the concerns raised by the author and proponents around concerns about persistence and biodegradability, and what kind of guideposts and guidelines that would look to.",0.0
False,,"Again, OECD, as one example of a number of entities that have guidelines and standards in place, those have been in place for a number of years, decades I would even say, and that is, those are the types of standards that companies are looking to.",0.0
False,,"They are standards that use a variety of tests with river water, fresh water, marine water is part of those testing protocols. And anything that would come out of that testing protocol that would be fragmented or what have you, would not pass that.",0.0
False,,So the alternatives that they're looking at and requiring those third party entities to meet are actually such that they have to pass those tests for the companies to even consider them.,0.0
False,,"In terms of those amendments we provided to you, they were in a good faith effort to try and say, okay, there are guideposts in place that would potentially get to those concerns around persistence. Further, it's not often you have companies, industry-oriented entities coming to you and saying we're open to further regulation.",0.0
False,,"The language, again, was in a good faith effort to say, if California wanted to establish its own specific standards for these types of applications, that we would be amenable to that as well. Certainly we're open to a different approach on the language.",0.0
False,,I think part of the concern is we haven't made headway and the concerns remain the same as we have relative to that narrow piece. The microbead alternatives that we would be looking at.,0.0
False,,"In terms of also going forward with regard to peer review, these alternatives again do go through these testing protocols, and the testing protocols have been peer reviewed themselves, such that they use, again, fresh water, marine water as part of those testing procedures.",0.0
False,,"Its not just out of the tap, and just testing against non-related natural environment type things. That said, each natural environment is somewhat different based on sediment flows and what have you. So the testing protocols try to set up the best mechanisms to ascertain whether these types of applications would be workable based on those protocols.",0.0
False,,"So with that, unfortunately we must remain opposed unless amended at this time. But certainly, truly want to be able to make headway on this in terms of moving forward with cleanup next year. Our concerns are the companies are reformulating now.",0.0
False,,A number of the companies have already agreed to phasing out long before the deadlines contained in the bill which is certainly positive. Some companies may only have just one or two products to reformulate. Others have dozens.,0.0
False,,"And so taking sets of alternatives off the market, or out of the ability to use based on the language in this bill, will hinder that progress in a much more expedited fashion and leave us with very few alternatives, Potentially resulting in wide scale products coming off shelves entirely.",0.0
False,,So for those reasons we remain opposed unless amended. And I'm happy to answer any questions.,0.0
False,,"Hi, Beth Percynski with Procter and Gamble, opposed unless amended. Thank you.",0.0

False,,"If I may, Mr. Chair, in terms of that, often times, these sorts of kind of standards are provided, the authority to develop the specific standards are delegated to the agencies that kind of have jurisdiction over that.",0.0
False,,"In that they had the technical expertise on these issue areas. Certainly, again, this amendment was truthfully, in an effort to try and have some sort of framework to work from. And in an effort to try address some of the concerns and provide some semblance of guide posts around the established standards that are already in place.",0.0
False,,"And what the state of California may look to as something that is acceptable, workable until the state may decide to do its own. Also, I would note as part of the Green Chemistry programs, Safer Consumer Products programs,",0.0

False,,"Not exactly the same but in terms of the details of those sorts of things, Green Chemistry was set up so that the scientists could establish the parameters for review of various chemicals and products. But again, we're happy to even look at additional different language.",0.0
False,,"The key here was, is that it was our intent and our best effort to try and have some kind of framework to go by, that would provide some guide posts and parameters. If it needs to be kind of a different framework that this, our interest is really that we're not cutting off the innovative, new technologies that are already commercially available,",0.0
False,,"but also a number that are still in production that rapidly degrade based on testings thus far, even faster than that's what commercially available now.",0.0
False,,Thank you Mr. Hill I would just. I apologize.,0.0
False,,"I apologize Mr. Chair, thank you. I would just note that we appreciate those comments. I think, again based on what Mr. Murray has articulated, it was based on that conversation that we put together this language to try and get to that type of a concept.",0.0
False,,"And so again, these are the guidelines and standards already in place for talking about persistence, looking at persistence in biodegradability. And so again it was in that kind of frame of mind that we offered these, which was tried to get there.",0.0
False,,"Further I would just note that the companies do require certification from their supply chain entities that would be providing these alternatives.

False,,"How practical is this here, up here and how practical is this cord here? I can see this strangling me. Have you tested it with actual law enforcement who gone through some kind of training or some exercise to see whether or not how practical whatever the application is?",0.0
False,,"So the answer is no, you do not test it? And you do not test it ahead of time, the way your answer is you sell it, send it out, hope that it works, and then it comes back, that, do you get where I'm-",0.0
False,,So before you sell something to someone I would hope that you test it before you-,0.0
False,,Send it out on the field because they're in some very dangerous positions and this is fairly important.,0.0

False,,"But this whole concept of these millions and millions of hours and hours of tapes that we have and we don't take advantage of using those hours as a training tool, kind of disturbs me. That it could be used as a punitive measure for the most part as opposed to, as opportunity to make better law enforcement officers.",0.0
False,,"And so I hope, as we move through this, that all of law enforcement and also the community will give managers, that are in law enforcement, an opportunity to use this footage as not something to beat officers, law enforcements over their head, but as an opportunity for them to get better, improve.",0.0
False,,"As you know, you give a speech, when you get in front of a mirror, that's and when you review later how you get a speech, you get better at it. I would hope that as you start to interact with the public, people can come through, especially they're just supervising, give them pointers on how to interact better, so that they get better at it over a long period of time, especially if you're looking at a million hours worth of tapes just in LAPD alone.",0.0
False,,"Hopefully 99% of that is about improving law enforcement, not 99% of it is looking at what has happened with some bad actors. And in part two is my question. Hopefully you heard LAPD speak about their procedures, which they probably gave more about what happens when there's an unfortunate incident, especially firearm, someone getting shot, someone getting killed.",0.0
False,,"It appears to me that there's an unbelievable process that one law enforcement officer has to go through. It's not just, write a report and it's over. I have a feeling from what I've heard today, and hopefully you've heard, there's not only internal affairs, you have to be interviewed by probably several officers and command officers.",0.0
False,,"It's not just write a report and then that becomes the sacred cow. There's a lot of interrogating that goes on with that and for the first time, I got a feel for that, and I got a feeling if we were to, without getting into an officer's Bill of Rights, but if we were to get into what is the actual process that an officer who has the unfortunate opportunity to discharge their weapon, what they go through.",0.0
False,,"And if the public were to see how intense that investigation could be, do you think they might have a little more trust in the system that they're looking at now, where allowing an officer to review the tape before they write a report. Knowing that, they will go through some intense scrutiny, if that happened.",0.0
False,,"Or because you're members of Policy Link, NAACP or ACLU, do you think that the process now is not intense enough that the body cameras will add a window to it? What, right now, there is a process in place that doesn't seem to give you comfort that will get to the truth and you're looking for body cameras to ultimately get there.",0.0
False,,Get where I am going?,0.0
False,,"And I want to thank you both for coming here today and, Chief Carli, it looks like you've done a lot of work on this, which is really good, especially for this committee to hear from you and hear about the policies.",0.0
False,,"And Captain Rich Desmond, we've been talking and I'm really pleased that Commissioner Farrow, Joe Farrow, is willing to go ahead with the policy, and no disrespect to the Los Angeles Police Department, cuz I came from the city of LA, or Vacaville. I'm hoping that the Highway Patrol of California still has the best policies and procedures worldwide.",0.0
False,,"So I'm just gonna put that in there since I'm advocating for them to have it. But most important, both the Highway Patrol Association and the management for Highway Patrol rank-and-file are fully working together to integrate and make sure that we come up with something that actually works.",0.0
False,,"So my question for both of you or one of you, I know highway patrol has had car cameras. And I guess you've had some usage with cameras. This whole discussion about having an officer do the report before they view the camera.",0.0
False,,"Have you prosecuted or found, especially when use of force is being done, have you had incidents where you've discovered that their recollection and what they were doing, they kind of concealed?",0.0
False,,"Now I'm talking about the 1%, I'm not talking about the 99%, so let's not everybody get all crazy here. But at the end of the day, you do have some officers that may want to corrupt the report. And have you, for lack of a better word, busted some and found that the tape was instrumental in ferreting out the truth? Which is what we're really trying to get to, in real life.",0.0
False,,Thank you.,0.0
False,,"So in my questioning I was trying to get to that whole point that there's a whole process that an officer goes through when there's an incident. If when a body camera you show, you can see an officer shooting someone in the back six times. I would think you may not allow that person to write a report before they do that. To your point, that shouldn't be the case. If it looks like it's a criminal act, that they then become criminals. And they have a different procedure.",0.0
False,,"And so when I was asking about internal affairs with the previous panel. Or when I was asking, have you prosecuted anyone from doing anything malicious with the report, I don't think they thought about the whole process of the investigation including the DA's office and judges and juries. Obviously right now there is not a whole lot of faith in grand juries or DAs, also right now. So we're not here to have that discussion right now.",0.0
False,,"So the whole system right now is under siege as far as accountability. And so when it comes to having faith in the system, the suggestion you made that when it's a criminal act that maybe this should not be perceived as a regular routine type of traffic stop, especially when someone dies and there's a shooting. And I think that may help us move forward with, whether or not we do reports before or after. And so I, that's an interesting suggestion you made about doing that. And so, how do we move forward with that when it seems like, as if law enforcement is against it? Is this something that the DA's office would recommend or think about doing?",0.0
False,,I know.,0.0
False,,"Thank you for the information on body cameras, and investigative records, and hopefully, you can keep us abreast of what that is, how that's proceeding.

There's no reason in this day and age that a bucket and shovel should still be the standard items used to clean up contaminated shorelines.",0.0
False,,"Unfortunately, technological advances and oil spill response, containment, and clean up have not been thoroughly investigated. Under the bill, OSPR would be required to look into potential clean up tools and report to the legislature about best available technology.",0.0

False,,the city of Stockton is considering and would like To be able to enter into a contract with FPPC. So just like San Bernardino does. They're entering there next year. They would reimburse the cost. They don't have the infrastructure and our county DA has a lot more things to do than do campaign finance and,0.0

False,,"Right. So in doing so, I guess I don't understand. If you looked at it from the point of view of a neighbor, seems that you're providing greater leniency in a neighborhood for where someone may be able to live, when previously they would not be able to live.",0.0
False,,"And maybe you could address the issue of a, where is the role of neighbors in this processes, this new legal process that you're suggesting? How do neighbors get notified? Who's going to speak for them? And then, what's their ability to be informed about a potential change in their neighborhood that a court decision may create?",0.0
False,,"But it maybe, but my concern is that what's the ability of a neighborhood to defend themselves in any kind of court action that may be contemplated? Who's gonna notify them and give them the ability to have their voice be heard in the process? That's what I'm failing to see in this proposal.",0.0
False,,All right. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Aye.,0.0
False,,"Thank you. I support many of the intentions of the bill, in terms of notifications, and in terms of extending the statute of limitations, but where I was having trouble was putting the burden on the person making the contract, versus putting it somewhere else that might be more appropriate, including the state. If someone is paid for their story in some fashion, isn't that a reportable event to the state? And if so, isn't that a better burden to place on our behalf, in terms of the notification than it is on a private individual?",0.0
False,,"But the trigger is the financial contract and I'm asking if the trigger was payment with the state. Therefore, they have knowledge of that and have the data that there is a restitution issue in play.",0.0
False,,"And that's for me, where I think I'd find a more supportive place at least for me at least would be to create a burden on us rather than the burden on a private individual that may not have any knowledge of the systems. I mean, if a state agency isn't talking to another state agency, that's our responsibility. But to communicate the obligations within this bill to anyone that's out there, that might engage in this conversation with someone who is a perpetrator of a crime, it just seems like I want this effort to be successful.",0.0
False,,"I want victims to have the ability to seek restitution and I also would like victims to have the ability to have as much notification as reasonable. And so, I'm trying to identify maybe a different trigger that could be in play that would allow you to achieve the goals in which you and that's why I'm having trouble.",0.0
False,,"Just to be clear, I don't mind putting an additional burden on the perpetrator. I'm trying to say, if that person is compensated, the issue is seeking restitution. It comes from a form of compensation and that's a taxable event. It requires under our current tax law, notification of the state either through a 1099 or some other notification that person has been paid. That seems to be a place in which we could make sure that our interests are aligned in terms of awareness of that perpetrators, potential for restitution.",0.0
False,,"And therefore, that's a place that can then go through the notification system, so that a victim has an opportunity to seek restitution. That's all I'm saying. It seems like that's a clearer track to me than to somebody out there who may be having a conversation with someone on a book deal or a movie deal, that somehow they would know all of our laws and obligations that would come of that outside of the tax laws. It just seems like that's maybe not as effective. I 'm trying to find a way that would be more effective.",0.0

False,,"Thank you very much. Good morning, Mr. Chair and members. SB 323 is a common sense bill that seeks to address the shortage of primary care providers in the state.",0.0

False,,"The California Healthcare Foundation reports that there are approximately 8 million Medi-Cal recipients, 200,000 of them which reside in my district. However, the system that is already struggling to meet the primary cares before the implementation of ACA.",0.0
False,,"So, we believe SB 323 would significantly help address the states primary care shortage, especially in areas that are designated as medically underserved areas.",0.0
False,,"For example, in my county there is only one physician for every 1649 residents. That is well below the state average, but indicative I think of a lot of areas of low socioeconomic backgrounds.",0.0
False,,"Decreasing the ratio of residents per primary care providers can ensure that patients with preventable and/or controllable chronic diseases, such as asthma, heart disease, and diabetes receive the primary care they need.",0.0
False,,"And I would add, especially in areas that are already underserved and have a higher incidence of these kinds of chronic illnesses, just due to issues around poverty and lack of access, as well as air quality and access to fresh fruits and vegetables.",0.0
False,,"Unfortunately, California is the only state in the western United States along with Utah that does not allow nurse practitioners to work within the full extent of their training and without physician supervision.",0.0
False,,"In fact, nationwide California is only 1 of 13 states that place this level of restrictions on nurse practitioners. This group Includes Texas.",0.0
False,,"The Institute of Medicine points out that there are no studies that suggest nurse practitioners are less able than physicians to deliver care that is safe, effective, and efficient.",0.0
False,,"SB 323 will go a long way to ensure the primary needs of Californians addressed by a highly qualified nurse practitioner, again especially in areas that have high poverty and are already medically underserved. We respectfully ask for your aye vote when we get there.",0.0
False,,"And if I could just add to that as well because I think the issue of the corporate bar. Again, we only have it in five states. And there's no evidence that says that there are better patient outcomes and protections in states that have this than don't. Right, so we have something that we're holding out as a standard of patient protection that there's really no evidence to suggest. The outcomes are different than in states that don't have the corporate bar. So there is that issue.",0.0
False,,Right. And nowhere does it apply to nurse practitioners and again we've all looked at the research that says out consult patient protection are not compromised under a nurse practitioner who does not have this level of oversight. So it seems to me a lot of this argument is around the instating something that everybody sort of agrees may not really work anymore.,0.0
False,,"I don't know about you but some of my hospitals, when I was first running. I said what can we do cuz the physician shortage. Get rid of the corporate ban. We need to get, if we can do that we'll be able to do a better job recruiting, getting people in. So again we're talking about a structure that, there's no big evidence that I've seen that says it provides a higher level of patient protection.",0.0
False,,"And if I could also just ask, just because this was stated a couple times, so you're saying, you'll remove your opposition if this amendment is accepted?",0.0
False,,"Yeah, so I was on this committee last year when we heard this bill. And, some people were here, some people weren't. But, we were sitting here, I was actively taking care of my sister-in-law who had been diagnosed with cancer and died within a short, two month period of time.",0.0
False,,"And partly because she had no health care insurance, she didn't have access to healthcare. Her only access was in through the emergency room. And I can tell you, that was an incredibly painful process, that I'm not saying it would have been averted. But it could have potentially been averted if, and",0.0
False,,she had seen nurse practitioners and other systems when she had insurance before. So it was very real to me in that time. Which is why I agreed to do this bill this year with Senator Hernandez. And people know I've been a longtime healthcare practitioner working in around the Medical Association as well as with a lot of nurses and physicians.,0.0
False,,"I think this continues to move the ball forward with access. And I think we don't have any evidence that patient care is compromised. It seems to me the one real thing we're arguing about right now is the issue of the corporate ban. And as Mr. Mullen asked about, the politics of the possible,",0.0
False,,"I think it's very clear that you have multiple sides and trying to move something good. I mean, you got the hospital industry. You've got the CMA, right? So, who do you want not to be with you? And I'm not saying that we should ever have to choose.",0.0
False,,"But when it comes down to it, sometimes you have to try to find a way to find that middle ground to thread that needle for the good of many of our communities who are tragically, medically, under served. So it seems to me that for the most part, people agree that nurse practitioners,",0.0
False,,"in their scope that they're already trained for, in their scope that they already practice in. That we all seem to agree that, that is probably a good thing, that we need to move it forward. And the crux is this issue of the corporate ban. So we're already said we're not talking about a huge population.",0.0
False,,"It really is, should nurse practitioners who choose to be independent be able to be a hospital employee? That's what we're talking about. That is a very simple, small thing.

False,,"What this bill is truly saying is dream big and think outside the box. But don't abuse the public trust and spend that money on our children, spend that money on our students.

False,,"I appreciated hearing the testimony from the attorney from CTA, because it gave you a good primer on how 1090 works for elected officials. But keep in mind, notwithstanding other assertions up here about us being public schools, we are public schools that are operated by nonprofits.",0.0
False,,"And nonprofits operate in a somewhat different world. It doesn't mean that they have any less interest in protecting the public funds, but they need to do things differently than elected officials. You are governed by 1090, but I would dare say that not one of you is prepared",0.0
False,,"to take out a personal loan at no interest or low interest to help fund the State of California. I think the same is true of boards of supervisors, the same is true of city council members, the same is true of school trustees. That's not true with charter schools.",0.0
False,,Charter school board members actually step up to make sure that their doors stay open. The Legislature and the governor deferd payment to schools including Charter Schools for several years during the recession. School districts had many options to bridge that gap until the recession was over and the money was restored.,0.0
False,,"Charter schools did not have those same options. We had board members who were stepping up and making loans to charter schools just to keep the door open. Low interest, no interest, it doesn't matter if there's a financial arrangement between the board member and the charter school. Under 1090 it would be prohibited and the person would be criminally liable.",0.0
False,,"That is far in excess of what the needs are in terms of conflict of interest. If you have a board member of a charter school who has a facility that he thinks, and the school thinks, would be ideal for the school. And is willing to give that facility for $1 a year to the charter school, 1090 would prohibit them from doing so.",0.0
False,,"We agree that there needs to be financial integrity. There are ways of ensuring that without imposing such an absolute prohibition as 1090 entails. We have oversight by school districts, we have other laws. Don't dismiss the corporation's code as being too light on board members.",0.0
False,,"It's not. I mean there are self-dealing laws in the corporations code that are very clear about what board members can do and can not do. And they are for the benefit of the charter school, not for the benefit of anybody else.",0.0
False,,"We think there is a deal to be had, we have asked that people get together and push forward with three-quarters of the Bill.

False,,"Absolutely, thank you for the question Dr. Pan. I think that there are two ways of answering that. One is that there is current law under 47605 as you'll see I pointed out earlier. The responsibility of the school district is to oversee all of the charter school, including it's financial activities.",0.0
False,,"And that includes these kinds of loans and the activities of the charter school in terms of what they do on a day to day basis, and on an extraordinary basis, as had to happen during the period of referrals. So, that's all ready occurring.",0.0
False,,"We also think in the other pieces of this bill is going to add additional scrutiny and transparency that we find very helpful. So the Brown Act makes sure that, even though a lot of charter schools are already doing the Brown Act, it would make sure that all charter schools are doing all of these activities totally in public at a public hearing that's noticed and agendized and the issues are on that agenda.",0.0
False,,"In addition, Political Reform Act requires, as I said earlier, form 700 to be filled out by all of its board members. So all of the financial information about those board members, just like you Dr. Pan and Senator Vidak is gonna be very transparent, very public.",0.0
False,,"So I think there's a lot of good things in terms of transparency in this bill, but we also believe that 47605 is, it's pretty clear about ensuring that transparency, as well.",0.0
False,,"Doctor, If you don't mind mine answering one more way and that is that 1090 is not a transparency provision of law because it is scorched earth as you've already heard. There's no transparency. The transparency comes in the other parts of the bill. That's important to make that distinction.",0.0
False,,"Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association, proud to co-sponsor, urge your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Madame Chair, members Rand Martin on behalf of California Charter Schools Association, when this bill passed out of assembly appropriations, we immediately went to Mr. Hernandez and said, you know what, we actually support in concept, the balance of the bill which deals with the for-profit issue.",0.0
False,,"Now we would like to work with you on language that clarifies what operated by and operated as means. When currently as one sentence, it is open to substantial interpretation by the state, by school districts, by for-profits and non-profits.",0.0
False,,"We've provided them with language which we thought was plenty of time before the policy deadline for their consideration. Which simply does define operated as and operated in by. And the most important distinction it makes is, it says that if you're a for-profit and you have one of three things, you govern the budget of the charter school, you employ its teachers and other employees, or you have governance control of the charter school, then you cannot operate in the state of California.",0.0
False,,"Those are three key elements of what governance and control of a charter school is. So if you do any one of those, you would not be able to operate. With that language, we would support the bill. We think it is a policy that deserves to be part of the California Charter Schools Act.",0.0
False,,"Unfortunately, those amendments have not been accepted, and the bill in print is what's before you. We think it opens up a lot questions about what it actually means. Not only for charter schools, but extension as Mr Jones indicated, to traditional school districts who are also contracted for services that could be construed as operated as, or operated by, but are not being held to the same standard as charter schools.",0.0
False,,"Again, we urge the committee to accept the amendments that we've shared with each of you and with the author and move the bill forward in that form. This is the last chance.

False,,"Senator Leno made the point that this can't wait, we absolutely agree, inaction for our community is gonna have substantial consequences, we're already seeing it.

False,,"Another way to look at this however though, is that people moving out of developmental centers into the community will save the state money and we have proof of that. The budget you just passed included a very clear reference to $64 million saved due to the closure of the Lanterman Developmental Center from people moving out of a developmental center and in the community.",0.0
False,,"$64 million was saved. We got none of that money back, and in fact, over the past eight years, we've documented now that this system and the community-based system has saved the state of California $400 million from people moving out of developmental centers into community-based programs.",0.0
False,,We haven't received a penny of that back. The other thing I did that I wanted to point out is I just gave you a couple of charts because this speaks to you a couple of the facts that were referenced by the Ledge Analyst's Office. The first is this chart that comes right out of the Department of Developmental Services.,0.0
False,,"On the severity of people in the service system, both inside the developmental centers and in the community, the discussion point was raised that people in developmental centers have a higher acuity, that they're more difficult, more complex. Actually that's not factually true.",0.0
False,,"If you look at the volume of the people in the community in this chart, when they compare people in developmental centers versus people in the community. There is often tens, hundreds, thousands of people in the community who look just like the people in the developmental centers today and we're serving them every single day in California.",0.0
False,,"They don't need extra treatment in the community, they need appropriate funding. The other chart that I gave you is a chart that shows the number of people that have lived in developmental centers over the past ten years.",0.0
False,,"And, if you look at that, any three year comparison of that chart and the number of people that live in developmental centers, that over a three year period of time, the reduction is greater than the number of people we have left in the Sonoma Developmental Center and the Fairview Developmental Center.",0.0
False,,"Except for one period in there, seven out of eight years, we've been able to move the number of people that live in developmental centers out into the community in every single three year cycle. So when people talk about how hard it is to close a developmental center to move people into the community.",0.0
False,,"We've been doing this for the past eight years. Over any three year cycle you wanna compare, we've moved that many people into the community. This is not hard. We should not make it more difficult than it is. We should do this and we should reinvest in the community just as has been suggested. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. Some of my members pay the existing managed care organization tax. All of my members would pay any new MCO tax, or virtually all of them.",0.0
False,,"So a vested interest in this issue, in past sessions, cap has supported a tax on MediCal managed care plan, that met key principles in any new tax that would go forward would have to meet similar principles including direct benefits to MediCal program, equity among the payers of the tax and consideration of affordability, in the healthcare system.",0.0
False,,"The revised MCO tax was put forth in January by the administration, we felt did not achieve those principles. But to be fair to our partners in the administration, we know we're not here by an act of state policy, it's really a federal policy, that is very prescriptive.",0.0
False,,"That makes it exceedingly difficult to find an alternative funding source that doesn't lead to market dysfunction or huge increases for private payers of care.

False,,"But we already have that for the large production, since, in the last 30 years. And like the author said, this is a unique program and different than a lot of the other tax credit programs because it leverages so much funding at the federal level. So we urge your aye vote, today.",0.0

False,,"To help alleviate the state's hunger issues and limit food waste, existing law authorizes farmers to receive a tax credit if they donate their surplus product to a food bank.",0.0
False,,"However, the categories that are included in that are only fresh fruits and vegetables, which leave a lot off the table, such as meat, nuts, dried food, dairy products.",0.0

False,,"This requires donors to use very, extremely complicated tax code, so we're also streamlining that. And to further stimulate donations, we're also broadening the categories of the eligible food, expanding the tax credit to 15% of the donated wholesale value and to extend the sunset until 2021.",0.0

False,,"AB 645 maintains the structure of the RPS which creates technology winners and losers and maintains inequities within the existing RPS program to the disadvantage of utility customers. The governor's directive in achieving the state's climates goals was to achieve 50% renewables and that's what the policy should do.

False,,"It does not allow charter school board members who step up far more frequently than they would often like, I'm sure, to keep charter schools open. 1090 applies to you, it applies to members of the city council, school board trustees and I, you know, not to take any away from, from any of you sitting up there, but I'm not sure that any of you would take a loan second out on your house to help the state of California close any budget deficit.",0.0

If they are prohibited under government code 1090 from doing that, then it means that that very important access to finances to keep schools open is taken away from us.",0.0
False,,"I also wanna point out that the proponents and even the analysis highlights several horror stories that talk about why this bill is necessary. I ask you, not now obviously, to dig deeper into those horror stories. Two of them are highlighted in the analysis having to do with FCMAT audits.",0.0
False,,"And for those who don't know, FCMAT is a team that comes in from the Department of Education to help a school district and the charter school deal with financial problems. Those were FCMAT audits. They were not abuses, they were not fiscal mismanagement, they were not fraud.",0.0
False,,"And those are the kinds of stories that are being put out there as indications of why this bill is necessary. We want to make clear, that while there are horror stories, all of them so far have been dealt with under current law. And would be dealt with even further under the three sections of the law that we think are important.",0.0
False,,"Sure. And so, a lot of the horror stories that my colleague was referring to speak directly to examples were there has been whether a lease or a loan of money. That has been very problematic. Folks for example, leasing property and then charging twice the market value and then pocketing the extra dollars. So its been a problem.",0.0
False,,"When the bill was in Assembly Education, one thing we heard from the opponents was, this is putting folks in a quandary. Well they have to choose whether they want to give financially, or sit on the governing board, and we would absolutely agree with that.",0.0
False,,"You have to make a choice, you cannot sit on the governing board and have a financial interest in what's going on. You cannot funnel tax dollars into your pocket, and that's the intent of government code 1090, to protect the public. When you do have a financial interest, one quick example, it doesn't necessarily put you on equal footing with the rest of the members of the governing board.",0.0

It's not ubiquitous, and where there have been cases, as Mr. Bramble refers to, the law has currently taken care of them.",0.0
False,,"The law, if it's adopted in 709 as we propose, would add certain things, like the Brown Act, where everything would have to happen in transparency, in public, with no secret meetings. Under the Political Reform Act all of the members of the board would have to fill out the same form 700 that you have to fill out, which discloses all of your financial interests. So there's a lot more transparency in those pieces of the bill.",0.0

False,,"You don't want them to make that kind of a choice. It really is a Hobson's choice that disadvantages the charter school. We appreciate why you want to do this, but there are other ways of protecting the public's money and we think that the rest of the bill does a dynamite job of doing that.",0.0
False,,"And if we could just take out 1090, we could also possibly get a signature. This is the same bill that Governor Brown vetoed last year. We've been doing this for more than a decade. It's time to bring this debate to an end and do a bill that we can all support.",0.0

I know what it's like when the political winds change, and that it was always the civil servants, and it was the individuals that had that civil servant protection,",0.0
False,,"I think ultimately saved, and I can say this now cuz I'm an elected official now, we kinda saved the elected officials from themselves a lot of times. That's the beauty of having a civil service system, we didn't have the corruption that you may have known about in Chicago, New York, Tammany Hall.",0.0
False,,"The whole purpose of having a quality civil service system is so that the public can be assured that everything will be fair and impartial.

False,,"And it is difficult, especially if you have a general manager who is not committed to it, cuz I firmly believe it starts at the top. And if you have a general manager firmly committed to it, even though you may have a mayor or a governor that's committed to it,where the rubber meets the road is in the hiring.",0.0
False,,And the only way you're going to get diversity is that feeling that your best person for the job comes from every ethnic background and that you do not discriminate because of that. You will get the best work force.,0.0

But it's not working.",0.0

And if you don't put people in place that are proactive to do it, even though you have all the programs, all the outreach, everything is there, but if there's no will to get it done from the top to the people who actually make the employment recommendations. I think that's where we're falling short on.",0.0
False,,"The reason we created affirmative action programs, is because to help those who were not socially conscience or EEO-challenged, get to those numbers in a substantive way.",0.0
False,,"And you working in state government, do you feel that if we were to have more people at the top who had more of an affirmative action, not background but at least were willing to look at it, because in LA. we have things called the rule of three whole scores.",0.0
False,,"And the reason that was put in is because I may have a 91 on a test, I'm sorry, the top person will have a 91, the next person will have a 90, I'll have an 89, that was used to make sure, as an African-American, I was locked out. So Mayor Bradley created the rule of three whole scores so you could go down to that third person, cuz what's the difference between a score of 91, 80, and 89?",0.0
False,,"And so that hopefully increased the number of minorities that were able to get employed in the city of LA. I don't think you have anything like that here. And with Prop 209 you probably couldn't do anything like that, but at least we should have something in place that gives managers an opportunity, who have that notion that we need to get the best qualified, but people with a diverse background.",0.0
False,,"So my question is, you think something like that would be helpful? Because all the programs in the world you can have. But if you don't have the will to do it, it will be very problematic.",0.0

False,,It seems this is an issue that the Board of Supervisors has every opportunity to engage in a setting of a policy if they so felt that was necessary. Why do we need to a state law when every jurisdiction that may use these drones can set their public process in whatever way they think fits their community to deal with it?,0.0
False,,"Right, but that's something that the local jurisdiction could establish, right?",0.0
False,,They could set that you need a warrant.,0.0
False,,"So why wouldn't we allow the Board of Supervisors in Alameda County to address this as they see fit, and for that matter, all the other jurisdictions that might consider this technology?",0.0
False,,"We do have current law on privacy now. I share your concern about privacy and the courts do on occasion have to interpret those rules on privacy that are in our state and national constitutions. But, again so where is there been a problem that we are trying to solve with the state legislation?",0.0
False,,"Okay. They use a drone in Alameda county, right? They currently have one now in Alameda county. I'm not aware of a problem in the use of that drone, are you aware of any problems there? I spoke with the sheriff and doesn't seem to indicate there is a problem.",0.0
False,,"So if the bill was more narrowly crafted for me at least, as it relates to proper search and seizure and the use of a warrant, I'd be much more comfortable with that. But this bill seems to be much broader in terms of requiring localities to establish",0.0
False,,"policies even- that really is their choice to what they want to do or not to what kind of equipment they want to acquire or not acquire. But this is a much broader bill than just about warrants on searches of private property or aerial flights over private property, right? It's a much broader bill than what you, what's here.",0.0
False,,I mean this is much broader than that issue.,0.0
False,,"From his point of view, this goes much further than his adoption of the guidelines. This requires a more comprehensive approach by the county, it's in their control and choice to do now or not to do. But it goes way beyond what he has done in terms of his view of it, that's why he remains opposed to the bill.",0.0

False,,"Good morning. Connie Delgado with the California Hospital Association, wanting to thank the author for tackling this issue.

False,,I have two questions to raise.,0.0
False,,"One is, your bill defines stop as involving a search. It's not anytime a police officer stops someone for a ticket, or some other reason right, is that correct? That the definition is only when a search is conducted?",0.0
False,,"So then, did I read the analysis incorrectly when it defines stop?",0.0
False,,"I'm looking on page four of nine. Says this bill defines stops for purposes of this section as any detention by a police officer, in which the police officer conducts a search.",0.0
False,,Including a consensual search to the person's body or property and the person's possessions or control.,0.0
False,,"All right. And Dr. Weber, this is the kind of thing obviously is totally unacceptable, if it's happening. Certainly the collection of data seems like a reasonable response to the concerns that have been raised.",0.0
False,,"My question is not just unique to this issue but to others as well. Any thoughts to putting a ten year sunset on this to give it a good chance for the data to be collected and analyzed, and then for the matter to be reevaluated ten years from now to see if it's still something that's required. Have you given any thought to that?",0.0
False,,"I think that, not just on this issue, but there are many others in state government where we might be served by giving something a good chance to see if it's there. Certainly be something that I'd be supportive of.",0.0

False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members, Carl London here, representing California Disability Services Association. We're a organization of a hundred community based organizations that serve people with developmental disabilities throughout California. The minimum wage legislation that we're talking about here has the potential to affect us in three ways.",0.0
False,,"One, impact on the entry level workers we have that work in this field obviously raising that rate. The second is compaction on those people who have been in the field for a little while and are just above that line.",0.0
False,,"And a third is on the exempt staff, people that we have in supervisors' positions, for example, who in order to be exempt from overtime and other laws have to make at least twice minimum wage, as was explained earlier by one of the early advocates.",0.0
False,,"The problem for us is that pretty much our sole base of funding comes from you guys, the legislature and the governor, in crafting the state budget and in 14 of the last 15 budgets, including this one, there's not been an increase for community-based programs.",0.0
False,,"We've had the same 30% cost of living, cost of providing services during that time period and we have absolutely no capacity to make that money up because you guys control whether we get the increase or not. We can't charge or try to pass along a quarter per loaf of bread increase to try to offset the raise in minimum wage that we're talking about here.",0.0
False,,"We do appreciate that, at least this year, Senator Leno and others have worked on trying to open a door through the special session to raise this issue. There's been committees established on each side that have our name as part of that, but we literally have no capacity whatsoever to absorb this cost unless you fund us.",0.0
False,,"So we would ask consideration that this bill be amended to factor in those costs. In other words, a state mandate on programs that are doing the work the state is mandating us to do. If you don't do that, you're basically destining us to go out of business and we're talking 56-year-old agencies. They're working in every one of your communities.",0.0
False,,"The last call you're gonna wanna get is from an agency that says I've got 71 families who now cannot find a program for their person, their child, so they can go to work during the day, but that's exactly what's gonna happen if you pile on the factor of not giving increases to this community and then further exacerbating it by saying, by the way, you also have to increase the amount you pay to your workers.",0.0
False,,"We don't have the capacity to do that. So we're in a oppose unless amended category. We simply ask that you recognize the impact that you're putting on our agencies by requiring this. You can fix it. You can fix it readily, just by simply putting the money in that goes along with that.",0.0
False,,"And at least that doesn't add further injury to the insult we've suffered by not getting a rate increase in this year's budget. If that were done, we could at least feel good about this and raising our lower end workers pay. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Thurmond, appreciate the question. We'll certainly work on that with Senator Leno, yourself and others to, get at that. Again, there's three major issues for us. One is just the impact of the minimum wage being brought up so that impacts our lower level, typically entry level workers as I know you are aware because of your work in the industry.",0.0
False,,"Yeah. Secondly, is what we call compaction, which is the issue when you have people that have been there much longer than an entry-level worker and all of a sudden the bottom end creeps up so close that they get to where their experience is no longer valued. You can't really pay for it because there's not the funding for it.",0.0
False,,"And they start look elsewhere at other positions and will leave or have extreme dissatisfaction and the third issue is the exempt problem where staff, by law, have to be paid double in order to avoid overtime and other rules. Typically supervisorial positions, those aren't covered and we can try to figure out what those numbers look like.",0.0
False,,"The rate increases that you're talking about in special session would potentially help a great deal as well, but, we really don't have a choice but to oppose unless amended, to accommodate this and I do want to say that in past, in state budget, we have done minimum wage increase recognition's to put money into the state budget as minimum wage was drug up. We have done that legislatively, in the history of this legislature on a number of times.",0.0
False,,"Yes, typically happen through the budget bill where we've done that and we haven't done it in this budget. So we're at some point here the cart before the horse for us anyway.",0.0
False,,We can work with the staff to try to ask the right questions. The budget staff are much smarter than I am.,0.0
False,,"Sure and thank you for the opportunity nd let me try and be brief, but I'll hit a couple of general ones and then a couple that are specific to the restaurant industry. I think today's debate is fascinating. I've been at these debates for almost eighteen years now and I've never seen the disability community and the advocates in the position they are. It's almost like the canary in the coal mine.",0.0
False,,"In the past, we've had small modest increases over time in minimum wage and never this huge shock, that has my members so alarmed and I think you're seeing the same alarm there. Our option I guess and their fear is to raise prices to try an recapture this wage amount, but their fear is, to your point, people won't go out, you know, people aren't gonna pay a certain amount for a hamburger or a steak or whatever it is.",0.0
False,,"That you see a direct drag when prices have to go up that much, they handle a 63% increase in the labor. So I think you're seeing from this community an argument that, shoot we can't cover our wages and the state's not providing the support to cover this size of an increase and you're hearing, I think from us an inability or fear that there's an inability to recapture through price, the increase that's coming.",0.0
False,,I'll try and gather information on your community generally. I don't know about that. I think statewide.,0.0
False,,"Well statewide we had an increase to $9 an hour in a strong economy, so that's a dollar in a strong economy. So that's a dollar in an environment where wages had grown a little bit, but its increasing to 13, over the period of time we're talking about that has people alarmed.",0.0
False,,"I think we have a history of digesting, grumbling, but digesting 50 cent and dollar increases to the minimum wage. Pun intended digesting. Yeah, thank you. Pun intended. So that's what. I mean the two other things I just say from the restaurant perspective, I know from me, probably if we took a show of hands in this room, there's probably half this room that got their first job in a restaurant.",0.0
False,,"I did. It's sort of, we view it as the starting point and the entry point and with that wage comes training on how to show up on time and how to be a good employee and how to work with your coworkers and all those things that go into these jobs. Our fear is as the entry point gets higher, the ability to provide those opportunities go down, one.",0.0
False,,"The other unique impact at least in our world, when you look at table service restaurants, the minimum wage workers are all tipped workers, for the most part. The back kitchen staff is making far more usually dollars more than minimum wage.",0.0
False,,"It's the person that's earning tips on top of that and our studies and our data show that it averages statewide in the twenty to twenty-five dollar range. Those are the people who are going to see the benefit of this very large increase and we fear that it's going to come at the expense, you know, people that you actually intend to benefit.",0.0

False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans in opposition to the bill. Let me start off by saying that from our perspective SB 546 is not a simple transparency bill. The bill required my members to sell their large purchaser rates to the government, for the purpose of a specific regulatory action.",0.0
False,,"Mainly, the determination of whether the rate, that both parties agreed to is reasonable. This premise is fundamentally flawed. The bill sets up a system by which two relatively large and sophisticated market actors can shake hands, sign a contract and then have the government come in and and characterize that agreement.",0.0
False,,"This makes no sense in a large employer market which is why most employers are not asking for this bill and indeed, Calpers is trying to carve itself out of the bill as well. The large group market is highly customized with roughly 14,000 different contracts in place in California according to a survey that we did of our members.",0.0
False,,"Employers dictate many of the terms, sometimes they want to pay more for more services. The market is also primarily experience rated and what this means is that the projected cost for an insurance policy is based on the claims history of the party seeking to be insured, so the claims history of the employees.",0.0
False,,"It's also important to keep in mind that Health Plans in the large-group market must meet a medical loss ratio of 80%. This means that 80% of every premium dollar has to be spent on direct medical services. In essence, if there is a rate increase offered to a large purchaser, that rate is reflective of the underlying cost of care and services.",0.0
False,,"Sometimes rates will go up and sometimes they will go down and indeed we know and we've heard from some of the supporters of this bill that they rates have gone down in recent years in certain areas. If the purchaser doesn't like the rate they're getting from the insurance company, it can shop that rate in the market and find a different plan under guarantee issue.",0.0
False,,"There is nothing tying a purchaser to a particular plan. This bill will only succeed in increasing costs in the healthcare system. Even under the triggers in this bill, there will be thousands of rate filings that would have to be submitted to the Department of Managed Health Care and to the California Department of Insurance for rate review.",0.0
False,,"We don't believe this is a good use of health care regulatory resources. I agree with Miss Capell. CAP has a history of supporting transparency bills, even working with the sponsors of this bill to address the underlying cost drivers in the healthcare system. We even removed our opposition to SB 1182 last year by Senator Leno.",0.0
False,,"It's a bill that requires my members to submit claims level data that can be very detailed, which stops at the level of HIPAA related information that can cause primary privacy concerns. The DMHC has received funding in this year's budget to oversee that SB 1182 process,",0.0
False,,and so we're just asking ourselves why we're here again changing the protocol. And we would rather let that law work and see what benefits could be added to the system before we start changing things that are costly for my members and for the state. So for those reasons we are opposed. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Thank you assemblymember. Not to hit the rewind button but I do want to bring SB 1182 back into the conversation. For experience rated groups, which is primarily the way rates are constructed in the large group market, any rate changes are determined almost exclusively using the claims history of the group.",0.0
False,,"So the previous years' utilization in consumption of care and under 1182, the group gets claims data that's pretty sophisticated and goes all the way down. And I should say the only limitation in that is any private information that could reveal the patient and their condition. You know, we haven't got a complete picture of what exactly the data is that's missing, that they need.",0.0
False,,"If that's the conversation, that's a completely different thing than requiring the government to put a stamp, or scarlet letter I should say, on a health plan rate with a large purchaser that's already been agreed to by both sides. And so that's a completely different conversation. And if they wanna have that conversation, we can. But that's not what this bill does.",0.0
False,,We're opposed to that too.,0.0

False,,It duplicates existing public processes related to executive compensation.

False,,If there is a need for additional rules and regulations to hold officers accountable for decisions this is a questionable way to go about it. The CPUC currently has open investigations and takes actions to the extent of believes there is mismanagement.

That ban creates an additional layer of obstacles that we see for providing healthcare services to those communities, rural, low-income, communities of color.

So to place an additional layer of burden, and not allow for hospitals to employ these professionals, really creates a problem. This bill does expand and removes the physician oversight requirement.

False,,You do it by allowing incentives to go to low income communities with older facilities and older homes that are below code and you also do it by reforming the current retrospective process that is used to verify energy efficiency savings incentive programs that are administrated by the utilities.,0.0
False,,"You don't do it by creating another layer of bureaucracy, another layer of administration to say that the utilities aren't doing this job, so we're gonna do it for them. We don't think that will give you savings, and for those reasons we oppose this bill. Thank you.",0.0

We totally agree that energy efficiency is a vital tool as we move forward in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the electric sector.",0.0
False,,"We also think market transformation can play a role there. That's why we're currently, actively participating in the CPUC proceeding on market transformation and other energy efficiency issues to try to address some of the barriers and issues as some of my other utility colleagues mentioned, so that we can more effectively pursue market transformation, which currently the structure really does not assist utilities in pursuing these long term pathways instead of incentivizing us to using more shorter term incentive programs.",0.0
False,,"So among other barriers we're looking at that in trying to fix that in the ongoing proceeding. Another big question in the proceeding is whether market transformation should be handled by utilities or should be handled by a third party.

False,,"Just briefly, Madam Chair and members, again this bill is focused on notification that a contract has been entered into for the sale of a story of a crime. And importantly, first and foremost, this is about allowing a victim to be aware that something may be put out in the media in some form or fashion.",0.0
False,,"So that a victim and their family can prepare to see their story perhaps portrayed in some fashion. And so that's first and foremost what this is about. Secondarily, as part of current law, the Son of Sam law provides a ten-year window for victims to pursue civil damages through the civil code of procedure to seek damages associated with the sale of such stories.",0.0
False,,"While that is going to remain at a ten year mark, the challenge is, is that victims in most cases aren't aware that a contract has even been entered into. Such that they even could pursue that option that's already current law. So that is secondary to the initial part about preparing themselves.",0.0
False,,"But nonetheless, if a victim doesn't know that a contract exists, how can they utilize that process? In terms of the actual component of the contract, and any ability to veto that, this bill gives no right to the victim to interfere with that contract, and being entered into, from that story being told. So to be clear, there is no provision in this bill that does that.",0.0
False,,"And there have been some questions and concerns raised around the first amendment. We do believe this bill has been narrowly crafted to meet the intermediate scrutiny of requirement. Such that it meets on the state's interest as part of enforcing and upholding proposition nine, which is the victim's bill of rights, the Marcy Law.",0.0
False,,Which provided for victims to be made whole. And be entitled to and receive restitution for the crimes committed against them. So for those reasons we feel that this again was very narrowly crafted. And we'd also like to support the comments made in the analysis. Which is a very thorough and appreciative analysis about the concerns of the media folks who would feel like this is a chilling of free speech.,0.0
False,,"To the extent that they would have to do such notification, the notification is merely a simple FYI. A contract has been entered into. The bill requires nothing more than that, such that the media entity wouldn't even have to Indicate who they are. Such that the victim, if you feel compelled and want to pursue that civil code process to seek damages, they would have to then in and of themselves hire legal counsel to pursue that route.  So for those reasons we strongly support and believe this is narrowly tailored, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Understood Madam Chair, thank you. So with regard to the Son of Sam lot, specifically, about a criminal not profiting from the sale of their crime. So from our vantage point to the extent that there are resources exchanged, that's important for the purpose of this bill.",0.0
False,,"To the extent that it has an effect on chilling of speech, we would argue that because no details are required to be divulged as part of this, just mere notification, it would be incumbent upon the victim to actually pursue further detail in finding out if there is a path forward in terms of seeking damages.",0.0
False,,"So although they're related in terms of overarching principle around a criminal not profiting from their crime, at the same time we want that process on the civil side to be able to play out to the extent that a victim even chooses to move forward with that. But we really feel like this is nearly tailored such that we didn't require specific pieces of information regarding that contract to be put in here such that it wouldn't violate that particular provision.",0.0
False,,"Good afternoon Mr. Vice Chair and members. Robert Herrell, Deputy Insurance Commissioner representing the Department of Insurance. We're the Sponsor of the measure.

False,,"And we worked hard in negotiations on that bill. This is a similar, not exactly the same, but a similar kind of construct, for the life and annuities area, if you will. There are some differences. The analysis does a very good and thorough job of rolling through the issues.",0.0

False,,"Thank you Madam Chair and committee members. And thank you for hearing my bill today. I also want to thank the committee consultant for a thorough analysis. Nobody wants to appear soft on crime, however AB 610 is a pragmatic solution for alleviating recidivism as well as preserving the fiscal integrity of the state.",0.0
False,,"One of the biggest impediments to successfully re-entering society is debt. Specifically child support debt accrued by parents during their time of incarceration. Consequently, parents who were formerly incarcerated are released from prison with mountains of accrued child support debt.",0.0
False,,"A large portion of this debt will likely never be repaid back, as many ex-offenders are of lower socioeconomic status, which hurts them, hurts their families, and the state of California. This pronounced indebtedness not only feeds recidivism but puts an additional strain of both parent-child and parent-parent relationships.",0.0
False,,"In 2010, this legislature passed a law to allow for the freezing of child support orders for incarcerated parents if they had no income. The original intent of the law was for incarcerated parents to request this option through the court system or administratively through the Department of Child Support Services.",0.0
False,,"AB 610 extends this existing law to permit a parent who is incarcerated with no income, to freeze their child support order only if, both, I repeat, both parents have no reservations. The child support agency must alert the custodial parent before making any administrative modifications, and manage the subsequent court case if there is a concern.",0.0
False,,"This bill will also hold DCSS accountable by tasking them to assess the effectiveness of the administrative adjustment process and report back to this legislature. AB 610 will help curtail the problem of uncollectible and unmanageable debt held by formally incarcerated parents, which inevitably makes reentry even more challenging.",0.0

False,,"Thank you. I'm supportive of the Chair's recommendation, but I did have a question. In the event that there is not agreement between the parties, will this be able to come back to this committee for review, or does it simply continue on and it goes to the floor, and we bypass this committee on that dispute?",0.0
False,,"Yeah, but it seems to me, though, that if the dispute continues and it is unresolved that supporting this recommendation today means there's no chance except on the floor to come up with a different view.",0.0
False,,"So, but if the author doesn't see to any changes, to the 10% recommendation along the process, it will not come back before this committee. So if these negotiations break down, which I know we don't want to see happen.",0.0
False,,"If they do break down, it means that this bill with that recommendation is going to be going to the floor.",0.0
False,,So that committee will have lost its opportunity as a committee to cast judgement about that 10% with the exception of what we're doing today. And that's my concern about it.,0.0
False,,"Good morning. I'm Victoria Rome with the Natural Resources Defense Council, also in support. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, I'm Victoria Rome with the Natural Resources Defense Council, here in support of the bill. Just very briefly, we see this as a reasonable and appropriate response to the recent oil spill off the Santa Barbara coast.",0.0
False,,"It requires pipeline operators to use best available technology, including leak detection and automatic shut off valves to minimize oil spill impacts. The recent oil leak was not detected right away, leaving oil to leak for several hours, fouling the coastline and harming wildlife.",0.0

False,,There's kind of a method to our madness for why we're bringing all these groups together.,0.0
False,,"Because once we get to a point, cause this is with data collection, gathering information, but once we get to a point where we need to start pushing forth policy, the members that are here, and I'm so glad that you're here to hear this, the members who are here are votes that we need to be able to push forth our agenda.",0.0
False,,"And so we do have, we're real strategic in what we do.",0.0
False,,"But most important I think it's good for you as members of the legislature to hear from a community that you may not always get a chance to hear from, especially on something like this as black enterprise.",0.0
False,,"Whenever the Black Caucus has a discussion about education, which is our number one priority, I will tell you, it is our Chair of Black Business Committee, COBC, it's Cheryl Brown that always pipes up and says, yeah that's right, but, what about business?",0.0

False,,And my question is more of an observation and also kind of moving forward.,0.0
True,toxicity,"For me, someone that kind of went through the drug area when we had crack cocaine and we just lost our mind and we started locking everybody up like mad, mostly African Americans.",0.1891751885414123
False,,One of the things that was always interesting to me is that we had a lot of young African American males that went into that business.,0.0
False,,"And it is a business. And they started at the local level and it went city wide, sometimes they went state wide, some went national. But they had no formal education, some of them didn't even finish high school.",0.0
False,,"But they knew marketing, accounts receivable, payable, they kept inventory in their head, they were some of the most astute businessmen I ever knew, and they all, many of them, ended up in our prison system.",0.0
False,,"We've probably lost a generation of some really great entrepreneurs, who if they had had the right direction, the right resources, they could have quit Harvard like the person that started Facebook.",0.0
False,,"They could have quit a lot of the institutions they're not going into. They could have started a computer system in their parents' garage, and created Microsoft.",0.0
False,,"They could have done all of that if they had had the right direction and a place to go. And so my question really is, and what I'm really concerned about, is how do we start to create, because we're talking about jobs, and we keep talking about jobs from established businesses that aren't majority African American.",0.0
False,,"When do we start grabbing those young entrepreneurs, and redirect them, either in junior high school, elementary school, and redirect them to start their own businesses, so they can hire other African Americans, and so that we can create our own wealth, so they can learn what wealth is.",0.0
False,,"Because part of that number you see in wealth is not only owning your home, but owning a business, and this may be a question for everybody that comes up, but where do you see where we can start building that kind of infrastructure for the black community.",0.0
False,,Just very briefly and thank you Chairman very much for coming. I'm Susan Eggman. I represent the city of Stockton in the area so.,0.0
False,,"One of the things that I think would be helpful, especially since some of us are going to be around here a little while, is to just have more coordination and interaction with members.",0.0
False,,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I know my district pretty well. And I just met with someone from the strategic growth counsel about some of the money they're putting out. And they said, oh we had a meeting in Stockton last week and I'm like, well who'd you talk to and why don't I know about it?",0.0
False,,"Right, because I think, and that's an easy policy fix we can do that with contrast that come, programs that were, that there should be some coordination I think with members' offices and then we can help.",0.0
False,,Because if you ask me which organizations in my community can get the word out and which ones take money and don't.,0.0
False,,There's a lot of back story that we all know that goes on in communities. So I just think for all of our to think about. If we could be a little bit more helpful in coordinating how information goes out as we're going to be here a little bit longer.,0.0
False,,"Okay, I need you to wrap up.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Ms. Bridges, and we're gonna have the Chair of Business Professions committee who just joined us. Ms. Bonilla, if you would like to say a few words.",0.0
False,,"I want to thank Ms. Bonilla for being here and before you got here, because we all were going back. In fact, I was late getting here and if I were to sum up, there was like two or three points that were made about impediments for black businesses to succeed here in California.",0.0
False,,"One that almost every panel said, was access to capital and an inability for African-Americans to try to get start up money. Whether it's the SBA, where most small businesses are $150,000 but SBA's number's at $450,000 for them to even start.",0.0
False,,"The other is education of course and being able to educate the work force so they can be there. And as Mister Gibson, who is here, earlier said, the big elephant in the room is Proposition 209. Which many of us believe has been a beacon to stop women, minorities, and others from actually getting into, not only the workforce, being able to start their businesses.",0.0
False,,"And so, as we start looking at contracting with the state for example, getting those numbers up because a lot of businesses, that's how they get their startup. Either through government and then hopefully they can expand and then start from, and become a prime one day.",0.0
False,,"And be able to take on larger contracts and so we lost a lot of our members. But just about every member on all three committees showed up. And it's really great because wherever we move forward with, we need your committee.",0.0
False,,"we need Mr. Eduardo Garcia's committee to be able to move things forward, and it looks like we probably need to add another committee called Banking and Finance to flush out even that trounce of it. But if Mrs. Weber you want to say a few words?",0.0
False,,"Okay. And most of the people who probably had a lot of questions probably are trying to get their bills through committee. And so I wanna thank you for coming, but",0.0
False,,"I'm waiting to see how many people show up, whether or not it's one minute or two minutes.",0.0
False,,Two minutes.,0.0
False,,"We sure will, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Is there any other public comment? Well, I wanna thank everyone for coming out. We're about 20 minutes past our time and we're about 22 minutes past our time. Come on, come on up.",0.0
False,,"All right, thank you. One of the thing we're gonna have to, and I think I'm gonna follow up and I think Ms. Brown who's the Chair of this Committee is gonna follow up on. There was some interesting things that were said by Mr. Lacey and Mr. Burnett, who are African-American entrepreneurs.",0.0
False,,"We've been trying to do this from government on down or we talk to employees on up. But we never talk to the people employing people. And I think I will follow, I definitely will follow-up with the people who own the Burger King, and the Fat Burger, and the Buffalo Wild Wings franchise.",0.0
False,,"Because they say they do hire at-risk youth and people. And so what is it that you say to them? When you look them eye-to-eye, what's in you that says, you know what, I'm gonna take that risk, and I'm gonna go. And then when it fails, you don't give up.",0.0
False,,"What is it that makes you come back again and again? Cuz that's what we're finding whether it's housing, the formerly incarcerated. We have people that don't even wanna allow them to live in their place, even though they may have a great job and been working on it for a couple of years.",0.0
False,,"Once you're incarcerated, which is a lot of African-American males, for example, how do we get re-acclimated if no one will give them a job and no one will house them? And I think it takes a special kind of individual that can look someone in the eye and know deep down that if you just gave them a chance, they can make it.",0.0
False,,"And so we're gonna have to figure that out. Not only for ourselves, but for other businesses to teach them how to bring those individuals back into society. And I personally wanna thank you the California Legislative Black Caucus. Dr. Weber and I thank you, thank everyone for coming out.",0.0
False,,"This is just the beginning, this is the first step, probably the first hearing we've had in quite some time on African-American businesses. We'll take this information and maybe hopefully we can pose some kind of white paper what went on here, and then talk with some of the presenters about the next steps so that we can get to policies and some budget items.",0.0
False,,"But also how do we talk to the private sector to work with them to make things better. So again I thank you on behalf of the California Legislative Black Caucus and our Chair of the Business Summit, Cheryl Brown. Meeting stands.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Seth Bramble here on behalf of California Teachers Association, proud to co-sponsor this important legislation. As this bill has moved through the legislative process we heard an assertion from the California Charter School's Association that the authorizer approves admission requirements and preferences and would reject things that were inappropriate.",0.0
False,,"We have found widespread that not to be true, that there's a number of discriminatory admission requirements and preferences that we've seen in the state, and some of those examples were outlined by the Senator here.",0.0
False,,"One, in terms of requiring volunteer hours, public advocates put out a piece of research earlier this year where they looked at 500 schools, we're not talking about a school or two, and a third of those schools did have mandatory volunteer hour requirements.",0.0
False,,"Now that may not be a problem if you have two parents at home and one is available to provide time to volunteer in a school. But in a situation where, for example Grandma is acting as Mom and Dad and working two jobs, when they see the application that has a volunteer requirement they set that application to the side. It's a deterrent even seeing an application that has a requirement for volunteer hours.",0.0
False,,"One specific example at Santiago Charter School authorized by Orange Unified School District, there's a requirement of 12 service hours that parents are asked to state where they're going to volunteer that time. Or actually, they fill out a form here, or will they donate money, quote, ""for every $10 donated, you will receive one service hour credit"".",0.0
False,,"That's an example of the kind of discriminatory admission requirements and preferences we seek to eliminate. In some cases, some California charter schools had up to 30, 40 hours of required volunteer hour requirements per year for parents.",0.0
False,,"I did pass out a number of examples to you members of the committee regarding some of these discriminatory admission requirements and preferences. Those were the result of kind of a quick Google search, so those are probably not the most problematic examples, those that maybe weren't posted online and that we don't know about.",0.0
False,,These kinds of preferences in admission criteria become an increasingly creative discriminatory and limit student access at charter schools. Charter schools are public schools that must be available to all students. We urge your aye vote.,0.0
False,,Yeah.,0.0
False,,Make room for me. Always make room for me.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association, first I want to make clear, we're not here to talk about the preferences piece, or the volunteer hours piece, we're comfortable with that language in the bill.",0.0
False,,"We're only here to talk about the discipline piece. In 1992 when the Charter Schools Act was enacted, one of the essential precepts of the law was that charter schools would be subject to a megawaiver of great swafs of code relative to the pedagogy, the delivery of instruction, the operation.",0.0
False,,"Ever since that time, in the ensuing 23 years, when there has been a problem that has been validated, we have all stepped forward and fixed it in the law to make sure that the problem did not continue. What we are lacking in this bill, unfortunately, is a demonstration of a problem.",0.0
False,,"First, I need to make it very clear that despite some of the assertions by Senator Leno, as well as the sponsors, we are governed under the law currently relative to due process. We must abide by due process and we do.",0.0
False,,"We also must abide by a discipline policy that includes expulsion and suspension that is vetted by our authorizer, approved by our authorizer, overseen by our authorizer and if our authorizer finds that there's a problem, the authorizer has the authority to step in and either cure the situation or if it's awful enough to lead to the revocation of the charter school.",0.0
False,,"We have a pretty heavy sword hanging over our heads to make sure that we do the right thing and that we comply with the discipline policy that we agreed to. The author also has mentioned reports out of US Department of Education and US Department of Justice which, on the surface, sound like they are validation of a problem in California, but they're not.",0.0
False,,California charter schools have not demonstrated a problem in terms of suspending or expelling students at any greater rate than traditional public schools.,0.0
False,,"And in fact, in the data that we're more easily able to get access to, which is the suspension data, we actually suspend at lower rates across all grade levels and across all demographic groups. I wish I could say the same for expulsion. The expulsion data is unfortunately heavily redacted, very difficult to get to, so it's harder to make that assertion.",0.0
False,,"But we believe the suspension is probably a really good indication that that's the situation with expulsion as well. We have faced a lot of bills this year, last session, previous sessions, where we seek to re-regulate charter schools. If you're going to re-regulate us, demonstrate that there's a problem.",0.0
False,,"Please demonstrate that there's a problem before we actually make these changes, because these changes have heavy-duty costs. Both in terms of actually implementation and actual cost to us without a justification. We urge you to vote no. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Thurmond. In answer to your first question about the expenses and the cost, for those who don't know, who may be new to the Legislature this year, charter schools are not covered by the mandate reimbursement process in California law.",0.0
False,,"There was a mandate block grant adopted in the budget a couple years ago. Everything that was a mandate at that point, we do get some reimbursement for. But every mandate that's adopted statutorily subsequent to that, and this would be a mandate, we would have to pay for.",0.0
False,,"And if you look through the process that's enumerated in the bill, there are a lot of steps that we have to go through that we know that traditional school districts have to as well, but they get paid for it. So the hearing process, the subpoena serving, fees and mileage that have to be paid, perhaps finding an alternative program for the kid while the expulsion process is happening, would be an expense to us.",0.0
False,,"So all those things would add up and you magnify that by the fact that the bill applies not to just what we all view as traditional expulsions, but also wherever a kid is leaving involuntarily from the charter school for something that has nothing to do with an expellable offense, but is still a reason for the kid to leave.",0.0
False,,"That would still, the process would be implemented exactly like the process would be if a kid had brandished a firearm on campus. So, those are the costs. In answer to your second question, the answer is myriad, because every charter school is going to deal with things differently.",0.0
False,,You heard Mr. Paz from APEX Academy talk about how many kids actually do come back to APEX. And that they pride themselves on the fact that one of the things that they do is deal with those really hard cases. And many of them do end up coming back.,0.0
False,,"Many kids who leave who end up being expelled from a charter school. the charter school works with a school district to find a placement for that kid because the school district has more options available to it. One of the things that bothers us about the implementation of this bill, is we would have no place to put that kid in most cases,",0.0
False,,"because charter schools are just not big enough to have the range of alternative or options, for a kid who is expelled like a continuation school, like an independent study program. So those are some examples. With time I could probably give you many pages of examples of what happens to a kid. But everything is done to try to make sure a kid is put into an appropriate program.",0.0
False,,"Okay, well that's... It is lower. I can tell you that what you get back is much lower.",0.0
False,,"Okay, well that's news to me.",0.0
False,,"I think it's always fair to say that there are work-arounds. We don't necessarily like laws that create situations where we have to find work-arounds, but we're talking about that period of time that could be up to 80 days",0.0
False,,"under the process in this bill, where we would have to find an alternative educational program for that kid. Yeah, it may be that we can work out something with the district during that 80 days. But that's not always gonna be the case and it may not even be the case in the majority of situations. We'd be responsible in most cases to make sure that, that kid was getting alternative programming.",0.0

False,,"How would you pay for this prescription? What would you do? Today we ask consumers with chronic conditions, the most vulnerable among us, to pay this ridiculous cost, for life saving prescriptions that they rely on.

Some health plans reported that their would in fact be zero impact. And some said that the impact could be 0.3% a year. The opposition will also talk about the rising cost of drugs. We get that. But, whose responsibility is it to negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers? Is it the consumer or is it the health plan and the pharmacy benefit manager? This bill gets the consumer out of, what one legislator appropriately described as the clash of the titans. So we present this bill to you today and respectfully request your aye vote.",0.0
False,,Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teacher's Association strong support.,0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We're opposed to AB 339 and our opposition to this bill is fairly simple. Legislatively designing health benefits increases premiums, and so we can legislatively create the best benefit package in the world, but if no one can afford them, that's pretty useless from our perspective. And this has been demonstrated time and time again.",0.0
False,,The independent analysis of the introduced version of this bill does show premium increases of close to $400 million on individuals and employers. Now indeed Covered California has recently enacted in the small group and individual markets drug co-pay caps with the assistance of my health plan members that are part of the exchange. But they ran analyses of these caps and these results demonstrated some interesting things.,0.0
False,,"Indeed, the first year impacts on premiums were negligible. But Covered California did project that over a three-year period prices could increase by 3%. And that's a pretty significant percentage from our perspective, considering all of the cost drivers in the health care system. They also mention in their analysis that there is a high degree of uncertainty with the new introduction of drugs, the prices of those drugs, particularly specialty drugs, which makes projecting future year premium impacts difficult.",0.0
False,,"And as we've stated in previous committee meeting hearings, some analysts predict 12 new blockbuster drugs being introduced in 2015, and a blockbuster drug is typically defined as a drug that generates annual sales of at least $1 billion for the company that creates it. These are probably reasons why Covered California also stated that the annual evaluation of the pharmacy benefit Is necessary to adjust benefits as needed. This is to protect premiums and to protect the actual values of the products.",0.0
False,,"Why do acknowledge and appreciate the sunset that's being added to the bill it is a four year sunset. And drugs are expected to get more expensive, not less expensive in the meantime. To bring up last year's poster child for expensive drugs, that was Sovaldi last year at a whopping thousand dollars per pill. The son of Sovaldi, Harvoni, the follow-up pill, was priced at $1300, actually $1350 per pill. That's pretty expensive.",0.0
False,,"We do acknowledge, and these are patent protected products. So the idea of that our health plans have the strongest hand in the negotiation process over these prices. There is at least some question of that. We do acknowledge that the bill is inching closer and closer to the regulations that were developed at Covered California. So we want to thank the author, the sponsor, and the chair for those developments, and credit them for that.",0.0
False,,"But, if the end of this bill passes committee today, we are not opposed and frankly would like to engage in future conversations about potentially tightening the language even more. But we remain opposed at this time, and with your indulgence Mr. chair.",0.0
False,,"If I could just close by saying that we appreciate your leadership in evaluating underlying cost pressures including drug prices as they have been a subject of committee hearings here. If this bill is enacted we collectively have no excuse for continuing to ignore the underlying price of drugs. We need solutions in our view it starts with transparency of drug prices, and we're happy to actually be on the same side as the proponents of this bill and the Chair of Assembly Health in trying to achieve that.",0.0
False,,"And so we do believe it starts with transparency and the rejection of the Orwellian concept that was stated in a previous hearing of this committee of self attested value to society based pricing of drugs, but we think that kind of approach is ill-defined and will lead to cost increases. So we would invite assembly member Gordon, if he was here, to join us in a discussion over transparency and other solutions that actually gets to the root problems of cost drivers.

False,,"Chair members of the committee, I'm very excited about this bill. I'm out of breath. Anyway, Mark Oprea here on behalf of our client, ChargePoint. As I know that you're aware, this bill is modeled after a measure that was adopted by the legislature last year, relating to solar permitting, solar panel permitting. As many of you know, when a customer is looking to purchase a new electric vehicle or a used electric vehicle, one of the issues that they're concerned about is understanding that they will be able to quickly and easily get permits for their EV charging station. This is true not only in a residential situation, but more importantly in a commercial or multi-family dwelling situation. Last year, Assemblymember Muratsuchi carried a bill, AB 2565, with the idea of expanding and authorizing tenants of a building, commercial or residential, to install an EV charging station If they were willing to pay for that. What we got from many of the commercial building owners, as well as residential building owners, was that they wanted to see EV charging stations installed, but that the permitting process was so onerous, complicated and uncertain that they were unwilling to go down that path because of that level of uncertainty. It is our hope that through this measure that the expectation from the driver, as well as the property owner, is understood that this is going to be a seamless and easy process that they can get their EV charging station installed. From the customer perspective, from an automobile purchaser or from a commercial building owner that they know that EV charging stations and there permitting will be expedited. So for that reason we would ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Chairman Bloom and thank you Committee Members for the invitation and for the opportunity to speak to you this morning. I am going to talk to you about the future of California's water and this is based on work that my colleagues and I have done as lead authors of the most recent intergovernmental panel of climate change assessment, the fifth assessment report that was released a couple of years ago and also the National Climate Assessment that was just released last year.",0.0
False,,"So the work I'm going to show you has gone through an extensive amount of peer review and represents the input not only from Berkeley Laboratory but also from many other universities from California and around the country. And it's presented to you, there's going to be sort of a darkness before the dawn flavor to this talk, so just please be aware of that.",0.0
False,,I think we need to look squarely at the challenges that climate change poses to our water supply and then talk perhaps about how we might begin solving that. In collaboration with one another.,0.0
False,,"I am going to start by reviewing briefly the present and I am sure everyone is aware of our present situation, but it is a challenge. We are fortunate to have resources deployed both on the ground, in the air and in space to look at this issue and the changes in California's snowpack are so evident that they are clearly visible from space.",0.0
False,,"These are two images taken from a NASA imager that my group and I use extensively in our own research. These contrast the snowpack in January 2013 on the left, and the snowpack in January 2014 on the right. I was looking for January 2015 and couldn't find it when I was preparing this talk, but believe me, it looks very much like the image on the right.",0.0
False,,"A dramatic decline in snowpack. 2014 also saw some of the, there's a striking image of Mount Shasta from the same time period with essentially no snow on its peak. So this is visible now from space, not just from the ground.",0.0
False,,"This animation shows what the normal snow water equivalent, which is what you would get if you melted all the snow and turned it into a swimming pool of water, how much you should have and it's on the order of 20 to 30 inches worth of water, so close to about a yard of water would normally be present in the Sierras at this time. At the moment, that number is down in the range of inches. It would probably come up to just about your ankle on this same scale.",0.0
False,,"So the IPCC, this Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has now concluded that the declines in snowpack and the earlier peak in snow melt runoff are likely due to global warming. They are now prepared to actually back stop that statement, and say that this is a clear consequence of the fact that the planet is getting hotter. Now if we want to circle back around to why the planet is getting hotter, I'm happy to do so, but I'm not going to deal with that in my talk just now.",0.0
False,,"The drought is projected to continue over most of the American West. So there are portions of the country, fortunately, where it's actually going to wind down or even decrease. Those are to the east of us. This projection that I'm showing you is from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the Federal agency that's really charged, of course, with monitoring our climate, sort of for operational purposes.",0.0
False,,"The brown region shows you where the drought is likely to persist or in fact perhaps intensify. And then you notice that's over most of the American West, except up in Washington and around the Cascade River Basin. So they're saying essentially the prospects for relief between now and midsummer are thought to be low.",0.0
False,,"For obvious reasons, we're exiting the winter monsoon season in California. This has had big impacts on our reservoirs and lakes around the country. These are pictures courtesy of an article that appeared in the Atlantic Monthly last year. So, kudos to the Atlantic Monthly for taking these pictures.",0.0
False,,"I'm sort of focusing on Shasta Lake. Which is well north of us and Lake Oroville, which is just due directly north of us. Both of which in August of last year were at 30% of their normal capacity. And there are lots of pictures in the same article that show houseboats nearly high and dry.",0.0
False,,"I have colleagues in my department who have boat docks where essentially the boats are left stranded etcetera. So that's their current situation. And I think it's fair to ask now whether or not this particular event, this particular drought, is certainly due to climate change. And I have to be honest here. This is a question that the climate community for a single event, like a single drought, cannot yet answer with certainty.",0.0
False,,So I want to be clear here. People frequently make this sort of really casual leap from global warming to single events like this current drought. This is actually a subject of active debate in the community and we're not gonna make a statement that we can't really backstop.,0.0
False,,"And we can't backstop the statement that this drought is demonstrably due to global warming. However, that said, we do know that major decadal long droughts, like the event we're now in, is four years long. Decadal droughts, like this could have caused the west, in previous millennia. They're very common. We know that they occurred, because we can look at lake beds, which have trees all the way down to the bottom. These lakes are only fed by rainfall. So if this lake has trees, fossilized trees at the bottom of the lake, that means that at some point the rain stopped and we know that we can find numerous lakes like that in high ranges around to the east of us in California.",0.0
False,,"We're also confident, and this is perhaps the most important message that I'm now going to segway to, that climate change is going to amplify these historical patterns. So this is one of the key messages I'd like you to take away from today.",0.0
False,,"That even if a single event like the current drought is not necessarily due to climate change, climate change will exacerbate and amplify the tendencies for these events in the future and these will become quite stressing events for the state water supply.",0.0
False,,"So I'm gonna start with the IPCC big picture, and then we'll narrow it down to the water just in California through the National Climate Assessment. So this is the IPCC statements about the risk to the world's water supply. Changes in the water cycle. This means the natural water cycle where water comes from the ocean and from lakes, enters the atmosphere, then falls to the land again, runs off into the oceans and lakes and is replenished is a cycle. It's certainly going to change in a warmer climate for reasons that are due to very basic physics, there's no way to avoid them. This is an unavoidable consequence of climate change in a warmer world.",0.0
False,,"It is almost certain that the changes in precipitation will not be uniform. I'll come back to this point in a minute. What's going to happen, we think, is a very clear pattern, it's a simple takeaway message, the wet get wetter, the dry get drier. We're in a dry part of the country. That's mean we're most likely gonna get drier, for reasons that you'll see in a moment.",0.0
False,,"The snowpack is going to disappear rather dramatically over the 21st century. Also, evaporation will increase. That will be another reason why we're going to lose water. And the one thing we know, almost for certain, is that the snow cover is going to be severely impacted by global warming.",0.0
False,,"So now let me drill down on those points. The basic message here is that climate change amplifies existing patterns. How do we know? We already see these patterns occurring in data. So this diagram is again taken from the IPCC working group report on which I was lead author. All the arrows on this picture, which have little labels on them, for example, changes in ocean heat content, changes in air temperature, changes in water vapor, these are all copiously observed by multiple observing systems. So every arrow on this diagram represents a consensus of many lines of evidence that these aspects of the climate system are changing.",0.0
False,,"And they're changing rapidly, and they're changing in ways that are historically unprecedented, at least over the observational record going back a thousand years. So dramatic climate change. And these patterns is sort of, it's an amplification of trends in the climate system.",0.0
False,,"One of the trends that's particularly important, and I'm showing you some, these are diagrams that are supposed to be sort of user friendly from the IPCC. I'll be interested in your comments in whether you think that they are. So the IPCC is sort of written essentially for Ministers of Climate in the participating countries from the UN General Assembly.",0.0
False,,"The message behind this diagram is that the storm track that brings water to the West Coast through the Pineapple Express, those storm tracks in the Pacific Ocean that bring water to our shores. This storm indicates them moving northward, and they're moving northward very systematically, and I'm going to show you that in the next diagram. We're not sure how this trend is going to play out over the 21st century.",0.0
False,,"But, what it does mean in general is that the areas to the south of us, for example Mexico, are going to get systematically dryer, and the areas to the north of us like Canada and Alaska are going to get systematically wetter. What's going to happen in California over the next few decades is a bit of a coin toss. But again, the wet get wetter, the dry get drier, thanks to climate change.",0.0
False,,"And I'm sorry for this diagram. I'll interpret it for you because it's written in Sundanese, but what this diagram is essentially saying is that the storm tracks are moving northward. Along the coast of California at the rate of tens of kilometers every decade. So play that out over the 21st century.",0.0
False,,"The storm track in the Pacific Ocean that brings water to our shores is likely to move northward by at least 500 kilometers in the 21st century. The diagram, all the data points to the left of the dotted line are actually, measurements from satellites, measurements from meteorological analysis of the present day climates.",0.0
False,,These trends come from present day and this trend in movement in the storm tracks is predicted by extremely simple physics that's baked into the climate system. You can't dodge it. You can't avoid it. It's going to happen.,0.0
False,,"So again, sorry for this flavoreth talk, we're going to sort of work through the darkness before the dawn thing. Then we'll get back to some glimmers of hope toward the end of my talk. I don't really want to focus too, this diagram is extremely busy but the main point of it is the upper right hand portion.",0.0
False,,"There are many aspects of the climate system which are still under debate. But one thing we're virtually certain on and one thing that all the climate models agree on is that we are due for much hotter temperatures. And those hotter temperatures, I realize this temperatures scale is invisible, under business as usual. The inner part of California's going to warm by probably four to five degrees, could warm by four to five degrees celsius by end of century.",0.0
False,,"To translate that into Fahrenheit, seven degrees Fahrenheit. And that's going to be the norm. That will be the normal, and change in the annual mean temperature. Heatwaves under business as usual scenarios end up becoming. What would be regarded an unusual heatwave, becomes the norm. And we actually expect those, what would be regarded as a distressing heatwave, to be occurring essentially for two months every summer, every year. So what this strange weather becomes the norm by the end of the 21st century.",0.0
False,,"And that those high temperatures, of course, increase evaporation. From our lakes, from our water delivery systems that are exposed to air, and I'll come back to this point a little bit later cuz it ends up being kind of a stressing factor. Evaporation alone ends up being a stressing factor for the water system.",0.0
False,,"So the snow pack, we'll talk a little bit about how it's going to change on average. This is some very nice but disturbing work by a colleague of mine, Noah Diffenbaugh who's at Stanford University, and this gets back to this issue around the abnormal becoming the normal.",0.0
False,,"This diagram which, again, I'm sorry for the small size. This diagram on the lower right hand side is showing you how frequently the snow pack will be in March, so like the March we just left will be lower than anything we've experienced over the last 30 years. And what the colors in that diagram show, is that in California extremely low snow conditions will occur every three years, so the abnormal becomes essentially the normal, it'll happen every three years.",0.0
False,,"Up in, if you go up into the mountain ranges around in the State of Washington, it'll be occurring every two years, so they'll be experiencing extremely low snow conditions north of us, so the hope that we will be able to perhaps import our water over the border from our stateside colleagues north of us may be a bit of a false hope.",0.0
False,,"This now is from the National Climate Assessment and my colleague, Mike Wiener, is one of the lead authors in this assessment This sort of shows the impact on the water system mid century. The color scale here, deep red is a 40% decline, so major declines in the water content and Snowpack. Major reductions in run off.",0.0
False,,"You can see how those changes sort of hug the places where there are rivers in the state. Major changes in run off from the sea rise, major changes in runoff along the coastline. Declines of 40%, reductions in soil moisture. All of them occurring because of the reduction in snow.",0.0
False,,"Now, the irony here is that California in total may actually gets more precipitation, why? Because a wetter atmosphere can hold more moisture and that means that the additional moisture can fall on the land surface, but it will fall as rain, not as snow, and we've very much built our water system in the state, at least large portions of it on the concept that snow acts as a time release mechanism for us. We bank the snow in the winter, we recover it in the spring and summer. It's been an incredibly valuable asset for us. That banking feature of the climate system is going to become stressed under climate change. So we may get total, more total water falling in the state. But it won't be falling inside the perimeter of this bank. And that's one of the big challenges that we face going forward.",0.0
False,,"And this is just sort of detailing this projected snow water equivalent decline again. This is broken out now by state, and the contributions of each individual state, the total amount of snow water equivalent in the American west. So obviously states like Arizona don't play a major role. California and the states to the north and east of us do.",0.0
False,,"These projections are showing declines by you know, on the order of about 60%. By the end of century, this is under a business as usual scenario. And you should point out by the way that this business as usual scenario is actually under predicting what we think climate change will be. This is a scenario for how aggressive greenhouse gas emissions will be, this scenario turns out to be an underprediction of how bad the rate of emissions increase is. So in other words, this is an underestimate of how severe the impact will be by the end of the century.  And so this says that the bank, the water bank, in the form of snow water equivalent, is going to be roughly 40% of what we've enjoyed during this century.",0.0
False,,"This has major impacts, particularly in the State of California. This is showing, again I'm sorry for the small font, but showing you the impacts in state So what this diagram is showing you is that the San Joaquin River Valley for example has 40 percent less water in it by the latter part of the century.",0.0
False,,"Ironically, other parts of the country will actually see increases in the amount of water inside their river basins, but we will face the impact of the lower banking of water, and that plays out, both on the San Joaquin, the Sacramento and the Klamath rivers by the end of the century. And again this is all information coming out of the National Climate Assessment.",0.0
False,,"So stream flow for the major rivers systems are predicted to fall by north of 20% by mid century and even more by the latter part of the century. So that's surface water. The other, the safety valve for this system for California has been the, like in another bank. This is a bank that is not being refreshed, it's being refreshed every year but it takes much longer than the creation rate takes a lot longer. This is ground water, and we're fortunate to have some gigantic aquifers under, for example, the California Central Valley that we've been able to enjoy and use.",0.0
False,,"Those systems are also in distress because they have to be replenished in order for them to be there for future generations to enjoy, and this is coming again from the National Climate Assessment a little bit later in the chapter that deals with water impacts.",0.0
False,,"And they break out the use of groundwater sector by sector. If you look at the total withdrawals per square mile, California has one of the largest. It's something like 500,000 gallons per square mile annual usage over much of the state and that's completely dominated by agricultural use. So about 80 to 90% of it is agricultural use. So we're definitely using the aquifer is a particularly important bank.",0.0
False,,"The challenge, well, let me just deal with that banking issue for a moment. So that bank is replenished every year by rainfall and from water coming from rivers at a rate of about 2 million acre feet per year. So that's the input into the bank thanks to Mother Nature. The withdrawals averaged over the 80s and 90s were, so the human withdrawals from that system were six times larger.",0.0
False,,"They were on order 12 million acre feet with maybe nine of that being put back thanks to losses from the agricultural system with a net loss to the system of 1 million acre feet a year. So, you put in 2 from nature, withdraw 12, put back 9, net loss of 1. That weight of loss and depletion has increased dramatically in the recent past.",0.0
False,,"So, that's clearly not sustainable if you want the bank to be there in the future. And the other challenge that we face with respect to water withdrawals, and I'm coming down to my closing slides here, is that thanks to evaporation. So, population, despite for a variety of complex reasons, probably because of substitution for humans into Central Valley in place of agricultural production. Population growth alone is not expected to really, greatly accelerate the stress on water withdrawals. That's what's shown on the left-hand diagram here. But once you fold in the fact that you're losing water thanks to increased temperature, you need more water to cool things. You're losing more vapor evaporation. You're going to significantly increase water demand just thanks to the fact that you have a hotter climate.",0.0
False,,"So all this is adding up to our two major water banks are getting depleted. You have a bigger demand, thanks to higher temperatures. So that's what this is now sort of a summary of the stresses that's coming out of the National Climate Assessment. This is just a reprise of what I've told you on the previous slides. So that's the challenge facing us. I think the question now facing the state is, how do we move forward?",0.0
False,,"One of the ways that we and the scientific community can work with the state is providing a more actionable, more accurate projections of climate change. And I wanted to touch on that, that point in my last few slides, then turn to your questions. We are building some of the world's most advanced models for the present day and for the future climate.",0.0
False,,"We were one of the first groups in the world to construct models, and this would've been in animation, but I chose just a series of single slides, as able to project climate change down to scales of 25 kilometers. We're building models that can resolve climate down to the scale of the width of San Francisco. We are surely to have models that can project micro-climates down inside the bay of San Francisco.",0.0
False,,"So this capability is coming online soon. We're testing these against the present-day climate. We are intensely interested in making these models useful to the state, and we welcome the opportunity to deploy this capability in working with the state in understanding how climate change will effect our water supplies, and what we can do about it.",0.0
False,,"And the other thing that's running to the rescue is the fact that this state has one of the most advanced technological bases in the world. We're bringing online computers which will allow us in the next 10 years to project climate. We can currently project climate down to scales of 200 kilometers, 25 kilometers, now 1 kilometer. So that soon should be able to resolve the, what's going on inside the City of San Francisco, for example, or between Sacramento and Davis, by the year 2020. Quite a powerful capability.",0.0
False,,"So the message I would like to leave you with is that there are opportunities for real and dynamic partnerships that involve an exchange of knowledge between the state, local entities, special districts, municipalities, state agencies, and the University laboratory system. We're ready and willing to engage in that conversation. I think it will allow us to harness the best researching technology available, you know, essentially worldwide to tackle the problem in state.",0.0
False,,"I think we could be very smart about how we go about tackling this problem. And really what we're offering is one of the world's best crystal balls about what could happen. That's what we're bringing to the table. And also a technological base and an interest in engaging, with all the other citizens in the State of California and how to solve this problem, both to adapt and mitigate it. So, thank you very much. Be happy to take any questions you might have for me.",0.0
False,,"Right, so as you warm the planet, one of the things that changes, and the reason why the storms are affected, is that the whole structure of the climate system is being altered. The poles actually both the North Pole and the South Pole are getting appreciably hotter than land further South.",0.0
False,,"And so you're altering, one of the major drivers for the circulation, in the climate system is the difference between very hot tropics and the very cold poles. That's a very basic driver in the climate system.",0.0
False,,"That difference between the hot tropics and the poles is being reduced because the poles, Alaska, Antarctica, are heating much more rapidly than land to the further south. And that, combined with some other factors, are literally moving the circulation system around.",0.0
False,,So this alteration in the large scale circulation of the atmosphere is following because you're altering the basic structure of the temperatures that we've historically enjoyed.,0.0
False,,"I think we're at the, this movement of the storm tracks falls out of very basic theory, it also falls out of the climate models. The climate models, I think, actually predicted it before it was observed. So this is a pretty direct consequence of global warming.",0.0
False,,"It's one of those things like higher moisture in the atmosphere that falls directly out of pretty basic physics of the climate system. It was predicted analytically before it was observed from satellite, and a colleague of mine at the University of Washington first observed it from satellite.",0.0
False,,"We now know this is occurring and it's a consequence of global warming. So what, the thing that's a little tricky right now is the reason why I wasn't able to give a crisper message about the consequences for the State of California, is that while the climate models all say yes, it's moving northward, at the moment they, some of them have this storm track position too far south, some of them have it positioned too far north.",0.0
False,,"And if you look at the net effect from averaging all the climate models together, you get what amounts to a bit of a coin toss. We're quite confident, though, that regions that are further north, like Canada, will get wetter, and regions that are much further south, like Mexico and Central America, are gonna get appreciably drier.",0.0
False,,"Let me take a crack at this initially, because this is my area of expertise, my personal research is in the causative agents for global warming. So it is true, and if you go to the Grand Canyon you can see a beautiful record of natural climate change that goes back half a billion years, right?",0.0
False,,"So, we know that climate change has occurred naturally in the past, and we know that climate has changed here in California, again, due to natural causes, so let's fast forward over to the present, and on time scales of decades to centuries, there are two quick actors of natural climate change.",0.0
False,,One of them are volcanoes. So the Pinatubo eruption that went off in the 1990's eliminated half of the warming that occurred since pre-industrial times. So the climate had warmed by Roughly three quarters of a degree centigrade relative to pre-industrial times.,0.0
False,,"Pinatubo cancelled half of that, over a three year period. So that's a fast actor, it put up this big screen of sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere, reflected sunlight back to space. Acted sort of like a screen parasol over the whole earth. The second fast actor is the sun.",0.0
False,,"So the sun, for example, caused what's known as the little ice age that occurred in the 17th century. You can see this in paintings all over Europe. People skating on the Thames, people skating on rivers all over Europe that were frozen solid.",0.0
False,,"The sun went quiet and that caused a, and this was observed by Galileo, and his colleagues, and this caused a cooling in the climate system. This can convert back quite quickly. We actually have very good data on both of those, neither of them explain what we're seeing now.",0.0
False,,"There's a clear fingerprint of mankind's signature that cannot be explained any way else, and the physics of this Plotie points to green house gases. And that is that the lower atmosphere is warming, the stratosphere is cooling, there's no way you get that from volcano's. No way to get that from the sun.",0.0
False,,"The only way to get it is by changing the green house gases. We also know, thanks to very good chemical evidence that the increase in carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere is man made. How do we know that? Because there's a signature of the carbon source and its isotopic composition, is sort of the weight of the carbon that's in carbon dioxide.",0.0
False,,"Plants favor light carbon, that decays away, and you get a completely different massive, it's a different isotropic signature of fossil fuel emissions. What we're seeing in the earth's atmosphere is a clear fingerprint that the increased carbon dioxide is from fossil fuel emissions, and also a clear fingerprint because the lower atmosphere is warming.",0.0
False,,"The upper atmosphere is cooling. That warming is due to greenhouse gases. This is evidence that has not been challenged. So, a very quick answer to your question, but as far as we know, and we know a lot, most of the warming that we're seeing now is man made.",0.0
False,,"And of course, there's still skeptics who are contending that this is not the case ,they have not yet been able to deal a serious blow, a serious blow to this diploid issue that I mentioned to you about warmer surface, cooler stratosphere, and the isotopic evidence is also uncontested.",0.0
False,,"And that's a very clear fingerprint, that the carbon dioxide is coming from fossil fuels, no other source. And it's not for volcanoes either. That's another, you know little ringer in the dark, but the admissions from volcanoes are orders amounted to lower than man made emissions of CO2.",0.0
False,,"Bottom line, sorry for that very rapid data dump on you, but the conclusion to data dump is that we are very confident that mankind is causing the Global Warming that we're seeing now.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.",0.0
False,,We're playing catch the hot potato. Do you want to take that first?,0.0
False,,"I think one issue we haven't touched on today that could be a bit of a joker in the deck is sea level rise, for a couple of reasons. This is one of those issues where there are black swan events that could represent quite stressing events for parts of the coastline. And it actually does come up in the context of water because you so often see major water treatment facilities at basically low elevations cuz they're being gravity fed, right, so you're feeding water into a water treatment plant or something that's close to shoreline because that's where it's being fed from communities or industries uphill. The estimates of sea level rise between the fourth assessment report on which I was also lead author and the fifth assessment report increased by a factor of three. So they went from 30 centimeters, because we didn't include land glaciers and ice sheet decline, to a meter, a sort of central estimate. But that meter has what we call a fat-tailed distribution, so it has a long tail that goes to much higher impacts. And the upper bound on that was about 2 meters, so 6 feet by 2100. So this intersects, both this issue on adaptation and what the communities are gonna do, but also intersects with the water system. And it's been, I will say, this is probably a side bar to your immediate question but It's been interesting trying to discuss with communities around the Bay Area how they plan to address this. And the challenge that we face, I think, which may get into some other issues, is that the shoreline or the bay system, if I'm not mistaken, is about 500 linear miles with about 150 different agencies and other entities that govern that shoreline. How you come up with, and I'm not being parochial, how do you deal with just that entity, the Bay Area, much less the rest of the coast of California, and come up with a consensus position around adaptation that logically deals with the issues of intersectional communities, water, and governance is one where I think, we don't yet really have an adequate strategy for dealing it, cuz it touches so many sectors. And so that's an area I just wanted to flag for this Committee's consideration. Where, I think concerted action is required and the appropriate mechanisms for that concerted action may not yet be in place.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, my name is Will Barrett I'm with the American Lung Association of California. I first want to thank you for holding this great discussion today. This is actually National Public Health Week and yesterday President Obama and the Surgeon General made climate change at the forefront of all the messaging they did because of the significant health impacts that climate change is having and will continue to have without strong leadership.",0.0
False,,"We believe California's leadership is really leading the way on reducing air pollution and fighting climate change. We think that, along with many of our public health colleagues, that this is really critical to protecting public health, especially in our most disadvantaged communities as Strella noted.",0.0
False,,"Our research at the Lung Association, we found that AB 32 programs are really working and really reducing the air pollution and respiratory health impact of air pollution as they cut carbon pollution.

False,,"That's thousands and thousands of asthma attacks avoided because we're cleaning up our fuels. Similarly, we did a report last year on the San Joaquin Valley implementing SB 375 smart growth strategies, and found that there throughout the valley, more walkable communities could really reduce the health damages by about $400 million a year over current sprawl oriented growth.",0.0
False,,"So I just wanted to kind of say that I appreciated Dr. Greenblatt for noting that we need to move our climate and pollution policies together, really to maximize both at the same time. California's made tremendous progress, but we still have out 70% or more of our population living in counties with unhealthy air.",0.0
False,,"So we know we need to do more. We know we need to celebrate the success we've had. But we also need to invest more into clean technology, we need to reduce air pollution and climate change, but also in the smart growth strategy, the natural resource strategies that we heard about today.",0.0
False,,"We strongly support all of the investment discussion that Strella brought up in the 535 quad recommendations and just wanted to again thank you and look forward to working with you to protect the public health and air quality in California as we fight climate change and continue to lead the fight, thank you.",0.0

False,,"It has been denied in years past, but we should mention that the department this year did exclude some populations, many of which are going to be new to managed care.

False,,"That's Idaho and Arkansas, plus California. So we would strongly urge you to go back to the 60 month, that's what the feds allow for. And we should do that. And then the final thing is that the earned income disregards. Right now the earned income disregard is $225 a month. That was put in there in 1998. In today's dollars, with CNI, that is equal to $344.",0.0
False,,"So we should go back up to $344 and if the parent who's working is meeting the federal work participation rates this should be included in the family budget unit for determination of eligibility and payment. Because there's a whole bunch of parents who have timed out, and it really doesn't pay for them to work.",0.0
False,,"A lot of these families who are working 20 hours a week, what they really benefit is $2 an hour. That's all they get because your benefits go down, your food stamps go down. And then on top of that you have to pay for transportation, you have to pay for childcare. And finally we would hope that we could meet with the other thing I was gonna say,",0.0
False,,"that we spend about $6,000, per family, on CalWORKS. That's for their benefits, for them to house their children and clothe them. On the other hand we spend about $20,000 in a welfare to work activity for one person. So our priorities are kind of wrong. I think we should take care of the families. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,Yeah. We always keep hope alive.,0.0
False,,"Kevin Aslanian. From the recipient's perspective, when these programs started in California way back in '92, they did a needs assessment to see what percentage of the cases would need the child care. And the number was 70% would need childcare.",0.0
False,,"In reality, only 30% of the caseload in Welfare-to-Work get childcare. One of the problems is nobody verifies that the family has adequate and safe childcare before they're being required to participate in a Welfare-to-Work program and the RAND study showed a lot of sanctions were a result",0.0
False,,of lack of supportive services which includes child care and transportation.,0.0
False,,"Understood. Good afternoon. Michelle Gibbons with the California State Association of Counties. First and foremost, just want to thank you the chair and the members of the sub Committee as well as Chair Weber for your attention on this issue.",0.0
False,,Our counties are very concerned about the issues of poverty. So much so that CSAC is convening a poverty working group and it's going to be led by three Co-Chairs representing the urban suburban and rural counties of California. We just look forward to working with the Legislature more on this issue. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Yes. Thank you Mr. Chair. Good afternoon Members of the Committee. My name is Rashi Casteroni, with the Legislative Analysts Office. I'll begin my remarks on our offices' recommendation to close Fairview and Sonoma developmental centers.",0.0
False,,And then I'll touch on two other recommendations that we have for the developmental center system. Our offices had a long-standing view that the developmental centers should be downsized. And that individuals with developmental disabilities should have an opportunity to live in community settings. Both state and federal policy dictate that individuals with developmental disabilities should receive,0.0
False,,"care in the most integrated setting appropriate to meet their needs. On a fiscal basis, we find that providing services and supports to former DC residents in community settings is cost effective. In our analysis of this issue, we found that the total cost to provide care to an individual in a developmental center is upwards of $500,000 annually.",0.0
False,,"In contrast, the total cost to provide care to former Lanterman DC residents in the community ranges from $75,000 to $300,000 annually depending on the type of care that's provided. As you can see in all cases, the cost to provide care to a former Lanterman DC",0.0
False,,"resident in the community, is significantly less than it would be in a developmental center. Further, as my colleagues on the panel have noted, the state's experience in closing Agnews and Lanterman developmental centers, shows us that DC residents can live successfully in the community. We therefore come to the conclusion on both a policy and fiscal basis,",0.0
False,,"the department should close Fairview and Sonoma development centers within 10 years. We think 10 years is an appropriate amount of time to ensure that the department and Regional Centers can develop community resources, and conduct appropriate transition planning, before seeking to transition consumers who likely have challenging medical or behavioral needs.",0.0
False,,"We want to stress that closure of Fairview and Sonoma Developmental Centers should be done with the utmost care, in order to ensure the health and, and safety of existing DC residents. And we would defer to the department's judgement as to which DC should be closed first. Our office has two other recommendations related to the Developmental Center's system.",0.0
False,,"So briefly, we recommend that the Legislature approve the Governor's Budget proposal to expand capacity by 32 beds, within the secure treatment program of Porterville Developmental Center. This would enable the department to provide competency training to individuals deemed incompetent to stand trial. Second, we recommend that the Legislature approve the governor's proposal to implement what are known",0.0
False,,"as program improvement plans, at Fairview and Porterville Developmental Centers. This funding will enable the DCs to hire additional staff and provide staff training, in order to meet federal certification requirements that are tied to federal Medicaid funding. Thank you. I'm happy to go into any further detail on any of these issues.",0.0
False,,"Sure, Assembly Member Grove. When we made the recommendation to close both facilities within 10 years, it was out of a concern for the health and safety of the existing D.C. residents. And also consideration of the capacity of the department, and we understand that",0.0
False,,"there is a particular expertise that's required to develop community resources and develop the transition plans, and ensure that all the residents are successfully transitioned to the community, and we didn't want to sacrifice or compromise those policy concerns in closing the DCs.",0.0
False,,"Hi, my name is Chris Anderson. I'm a disabled adult that receives services through California. With the 10% rate increase, our day programs crumble or be forced to shutdown and we won't have enough staff to train the disabled people to get jobs in the community. Please help me.

False,,"Thank you Mr. Chairman and members. Thank you for your patience for today and this hearing really appreciate this. My name is Carl London. I'm here on behalf of the California Disability Services Association. We have close to a hundred community based agencies statewide, also a parent, also the current President of a local agency here in Sacramento.",0.0
False,,"So, I'm touching in this field on a lot of different angles. One of the biggest problems you have here that hasn't been talked about is the fact that, back in the late 90s, we froze rates and decided that we would have a conversation about how we were going to set rates. We never fixed that.",0.0
False,,"Nobody ever went back and picked that back up. And all the rates were just based off of those figures at that time. And what you see in this rate chart is just the history of what's happened since then. When you go back to 2006-7, you'll see we had an across-the-board increase largely due to this Budget Subcommittee taking control of the issue,",0.0
False,,"forcing it, with three legislators that were moms, one that was a brother, bipartisan group that took ahold of this issue and urged the Legislature and the Governor to put the funding in like we're talking about today. We're revisiting this moment again,",0.0
False,,"and this time we're coming to you with a different way of handling it. People always ask us, where are you going to get the money? It's sitting right there in the developmental centers. The faster you do this judo flip, the faster you'll have the money available to help fix the community and make it better for 280,000 people, not a thousand. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Assemblymember Reginald Byron Jones-Sawyer, Sr., from Los Angeles.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, and thank you for your report, and I'm very familiar with your report. You do excellent work. And actually, this is kind of seems a little eerily familiar to me. With the course, for example, there's an operating overhead group that makes all the budget decisions for everyone else. And the money should flow down to basically the people who actually do the work.",0.0
False,,"And the additional audits you did for me, we've, or you found, as you looked at how the money flowed, and this is all about transparency, opportunities where we could reprogram, or we found out that there's hundreds of millions of dollars that were spent at the upper level that should have probably gone down to lower courts. What both the Chairman are asking now, is that something you could also look at? But more importantly, have you looked at that right now? Especially as far as transparency is concerned.",0.0
False,,"Are there monies that are being held back? Or have been purpose or should be repurposed in another fashion, or you don't have access to that information that we could make some comments on as a Committee to look at from the legislative standpoint.",0.0
False,,"Is what the Chair is asking now if that's something that could be incorporated, or is something we could look at?",0.0
False,,"Correct. Thank you Mr. Chairman. As you probably can tell, this whole issue of diversity is not going to go away. And I just wanna add this because you were talking about numbers and money. Spending $3 million out of state and $20 million in state, but",0.0
False,,"it seems like the out of state money's more effective at bringing in students one. Two, money isn't always the solution. And I think you should seriously look at the $20 million you're spending, because it obviously is not working. And to continue to pour money down that drain, that hole, expecting to get a different result is problematic.",0.0
False,,"I went to a real small private college in Los Angeles where our enrollment in African Americans is much higher than UCLA's. Our tuition is twice as much as UCLA and we've had a history of not always being accepting to minorities, except with Latino, African American enrollment, it's much higher than UCLA's. And that's problematic on a lot of levels.",0.0
False,,"And so, no disrespect to the people who believed in Prop 209. But if I hear another person tell me what they can't do, because of Prop 209, I'm gonna lose it, because we need to start talking about what we can do in spite of 209, to get the diversity that we need.",0.0
False,,"And if you haven't heard anything from this panel, the UC's better figure it out and figure it out quick, or we're gonna try to figure it out our own selves. And from what I've learned being a bureaucrat in the system, you never want elected officials to figure out what to do. You need to figure it out yourself.",0.0
False,,"Because if we come up with a plan, it'll be swift, it'll be broad ranging, and it'll be decisive. And so, if the University truly believes in diversity where on a campus of UCLA to have less than 3% African-American males on campus, god forbid if I take out the football team where your numbers would be?",0.0
False,,"It is, you should be ashamed and you should be embarrassed at the numbers all across the State of Latino and African Americans that they're on your campuses right now. And that should be a number one priority, and that should be an easy fix. If you're very good at going out of the country to get people to come to this school and",0.0
False,,"pay an exorbitant amount of money, you should be able to figure out how to stay in-state, spend less money to recruit people to come to our schools and stay in our state and be productive members of our state and just stop this word game. And again I don't care if you give $100 million, if you're not getting the impact that you need you shouldn't spend one dime, or we shouldn't give you one dime or we should give that money to somebody else who'll get the job done.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Madam Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We're, as the payers in the healthcare system are primary payers, both in commercial coverage and as part of Medi-Cal, we're very interested in this $300 million set aside.",0.0
False,,"We think it's very significant, not just in terms of it's size but the fact that the state is reserving this amount of money for one drug or one set of drugs. There is no questioning the advancement in healthcare that are made with these products but, again as it pairs in the system, we do have some concerns about the underlying pricing that is worrisome for both public programs and commercial coverage.",0.0
False,,"We did hear, Madam Chair members, in a State Senate hearing not to long ago that the makers of the Hepatitis C drugs do not use the cost development to price their products. We find that to be a bit curious and contrary to what the drug industry has been saying for years about why some of the products cost so much and it's also a different standard than other sectors of the health care system are required to live under.",0.0
False,,"We are very interested and encouraged by the fact the state is making progress in their negotiations on rebates with the makers of these drugs. We do want to point out this isn't just about Civaldi, as an earlier witness testified, it's about the pipeline.",0.0
False,,"70% of the new FDA approvals in 2013 were specialty drugs which tend to be higher on the price tag end. It's also expected that in 2015, 15 new blockbuster drugs will be entering the market. And so we have some concerns about how we're gonna be paying for that in various sectors.",0.0
False,,"We feel that the need needs to be on affordability, transparency to answer some of the outstanding questions. And we would suggest that the budget committees ask the LAO In addition to the work that they're doing as part of the May revise, the LA or any other appropriate state entity to take a longer term analysis of what these hepatitis C drugs may cost the state in the future.",0.0
False,,"We agree with some of the earlier comments about how that number could change, it could change in either direction. You're right to say that Senator Stone to say that about 3,500 lives would be covered under the 300 $1 million set aside. But we've seen information suggesting that there is 600,000 Californians that have hepatitis C and about 100,000 of those are in the state system in the various programs.",0.0
False,,"I think the numbers around 93, 95,000 so it may not be enough so we're very concerned about this and to both Senator Stone and Senator Monning's question, you made good points about the cost comparison of Sovaldi and Harvoni to existing treatments. We do have some information from a couple of our health plans that might be helpful that I'd like to come in and talk to you about, but in essence it's not a simple analysis of what the cost of the drug is between current forms of treatment.",0.0
False,,"I'm not a clinician, but I understand from one of my health plans that only about 1% of current hepatitis C sufferers end up at a point where they need a liver transplant. So those costs are large but a lot more people are eligible potentially to take Solvaldi and Harvoni so that needs to be part of the assumption as well. In any case, thank you for your time.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Madam Chair, Mister Chairman, staff. My name's Jeff Faca, representing the California Association of School Business Officials. Our organization represents approximately 4,000 individual members, as well as hundreds of local education agencies with the primary focus on school business and finance issues. So needless to say, facilities is a key priority for our members this year.",0.0
False,,"And I wanna begin my testimony by being transparent about what our positions are on the various issues that you've been discussing today. Number one, we do support placing an education bond on a state-wide general election ballot in 2016. Second, we oppose the use of Proposition 98 funds as a source for the statewide facilities program.",0.0
False,,"And I may come back to that in a moment. And then third, we believe strongly that any new statewide School Facilities Program must maintain the historic partnership between the state and local districts for financing school facilities. One of the, I think, recurring themes of the testimony today is that partnership, and so I will loop back to that at the end of my testimony.",0.0
False,,"I will also provide my prepared remarks to your staff following the hearing because many of the issues that I had intended to speak about have already been addressed, and I don't I want to be duplicative.",0.0
False,,"I did wanna say that I was very impressed with the principles that were laid out by Mr. Vincent, and I would suggest to the Committee that that may be an excellent yardstick by which to judge the various proposals that are before the Committee today, and that will be discussed over the course of the year. I also want to reinforce the point that has been made numerous times today and that's of simplicity.",0.0
False,,"Senator Liu, I think you have found a chart that is finally more complicated than how local budget approvals align with the adoption of LCAPs. And when I hear all the talk about simples I sometimes think back to the line in the the movie The Princess Bride, where they say I do not think you know what that word means. Clearly, there is work to be done on that point.",0.0
False,,"I also think it's important that we not lose sight of the importance of facilities in the context of the LCFF and local control accountability plans that each LEA must prepare and now update on an annual basis. Quote, unquote school facilities being maintained in good repair is a key component to the eight state priorities that LEA's are required to address in there L caps.",0.0
False,,So clearly facilities remain a very high priority for the state. And I think it's a fair question to ask whether with that priority and expectation comes a responsibility to maintain that historic partnership. The questions outlined in your agenda really go hand to hand.,0.0
False,,"Political and fiscal challenges and local options. There are really, I think, fiscal challenges as well as political challenges with each of those local options. As others have stated, there is a solid recent history of school districts being able to approve general obligation bonds at the local level.",0.0
False,,"In 2014, 85 of the 108 bond proposals that were on the ballot were approved for a total of 8.9 billion. So as a whole, it's safe to say that if you look at the detail within those bond proposals, it really covers the entire gamut of the issues that you're talking about today. New construction, modernization.",0.0
False,,"Bringing facilities up to standard. New technologies to meet with new assessments, etc. So that's obviously good news for districts that were able to pass the bond. But I think we can't lose, again, lose sight of the fact that there are also numerous districts that have tried to pass the bond numerous times, multiple times, and have failed in their efforts to do so.",0.0
False,,"And you only need to look as close as Woodland Unified School District, which had a pretty significant proposal on the ballot last November, and I think received somewhere in the neighborhood of 43%. So it's not universal, that rate of passage.",0.0
False,,"I won't go through the bonded indebtedness limits and the tax rate limits that were adopted as part of Proposition 39 in the year 2000. But, I do wanna make a couple of comments about those with respect to the waivers being granted by the State Board of Education.",0.0
False,,"Based on the data that I looked at, going through the annual waiver reports from 2009 to 13. And then looking at some data that the Department of Education was able to provide. It appears that there were roughly 40 of those waivers approved between the year 2000 and the year 2013, but 10 of those were in 2013 alone.",0.0
False,,"And I think that it's only anecdotal, but it may indicate a trend of more districts going to the state board to waive those limits, and getting at something that Mr. Vinson spoke about, those limits come into play as a challenge for school districts, because the research has shown that disparities in school facilities funding across the state are systematically related to the assessed value of property within those districts.",0.0
False,,"So if you're a school district for example, and Senator Block you made reference to winners and losers within your own region, if you're a school district in areas of the state that have had very low accessed valuation. Increases or even decreases during the great recession.",0.0
False,,"Riverside County, many rural areas and even if you're able to pass bonds in those communities, you may have issues generating the amount of funds that you need in order to, for example, replace temporary classrooms with new construction.",0.0
False,,"And then I almost to hesitate to bring this up but, bond capacity has led to some other issues. I think Senator Lui, Senator Block, you'll both recall legislation that came through the Senate Education Committee in 2013 that was authored by Assembly Member John Buchanan on the use of capital appreciation bonds.",0.0
False,,Now there was a reason that districts were using capital appreciation bonds as a tool in order to maximize the amount of funding that they could receive in order to meet the needs and the desires of their community and the needs of their master plan.,0.0
False,,"But obviously, the longterm debt that was resulting from some of those issuances was becoming an issue both for local and statewide decision makers. And so now we do have statutory restrictions on the use of that tool, which I think, many districts were using in what people would agree was in a responsible manner.",0.0
False,,"There are some other options that school districts can use beyond general obligation bonds. But I think that those come with challenges as well. There are certificates of participation or COPS, which is a way similar to using lease financing for roughly the same purposes of a general obligation bond.",0.0
False,,"Sometimes those look very much like a GO bond. And other times, they're used for smaller projects or purchases up to, and including, the construction of a new school. COPS do not require voter approval. But, they carry a certain amount. Perhaps significant risk in that the debt is service to do allocations in district's General Fund.",0.0
False,,"So, this is a fiscal challenge because the last thing that any chief business official wants to do is put his or her general fund at risk. And they think of political challenge as well, because I know from talking to many members and staff in the capital, that there have been many issues and a good amount of skepticism about the use of COPS, as a primary tool to finance school facilities.",0.0
False,,"There are also bond anticipation notes, or bans, which in it's simplest form is a way to provide bridge financing for facilities in the short term. When, as the name applies, it's anticipated that a distract will issue bonds sometime in the near future.",0.0
False,,"Those instruments are limited to terms of five years, but also carry risks and that it's never easy to predict the future. And if your bridge financing turns out to be a bridge to nowhere, then you've got a problem on your hands. There are lost or known not frequently use tools grant anticipation notes which are dependent on the future source of revenue.",0.0
False,,"Tax revenue anticipation notes, which are more commonly used for cash flow issues, but there are also examples of using those to finance facilities, improvements, and constructions. And then of course, a school district can also choose to establish a community facilities district under the Mello-Roos act. Or a school facilities improvement district.",0.0
False,,"Those bonds issued in those districts are a flat special tax on property owners within, in the case of the community facilities district, on property owners and taxpayers within the school facilities and improvement district. One risk that was associated with the CFDs during the period of the recession was the risk of default.",0.0
False,,"And I've been told that at one time that the delinquency rate, or the delinquent rate on those was actually 1 in 10 was in jeopardy of being in default. So again, there are options. You know, if someone were to ask me, which they don't frequently do, I would probably caution the use of any of those other debt instruments, but I think at the end of the day, when we're talking about what's the message to take out of all this, it's to reinforce what I said at the beginning, which is that the state and local partnership is really the key to the program's success.",0.0
False,,"Now we haven't had a lot of time to absorb and think about the legislative analysts' recommendation, but I do think that we have a fundamental disagreement with even the potential use of Proposition 98 funds for school facilities.",0.0
False,,"To me it just seemed to exacerbate the adequacy conversations that we're already having. And I can't remember, I think it was Mr. Vincent who said another key threshold question really for the Committee and the Legislature is debt. Bad thing, good thing, somewhere in between.",0.0
False,,"I think we would argue that there's nothing irresponsible. You know, there's always exceptions that prove the rule, but nothing irresponsible in the issuance of that. And again, we simply are strong supporters of maintaining that state and local partnership. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Okay, thank you. I'm a labor lawyer. But even though I'm a labor lawyer, I file briefs in a lot of religion cases, including Hosanna-Tabor. University of Great Falls Montana, Pacific Lutheran University, and California Supreme Court.",0.0
False,,"The McKeon case, the CHW case, the Bonds case, the Historical Parking case, the East Bay Asian, and others. So I'm a labor lawyer but I do a lot of other things that have to do with religion, some of which are employment, some of which are not.",0.0
False,,"For 45 years, I graduated in '71, I've represented, for most of the people in this room on the [INAUDIBLE]. For 45 years I've represented religions Religious schools, religious hospitals, and other types of religious entities.",0.0
False,,"I'm familiar with the way many of them operate, the religious work that they perform, and their need for and their constitutional right to religious autonomy. Which includes defining who will be their spokespersons or their ministers and the right to select them. I'd like to start with a few preliminary remarks.",0.0
False,,"That there are some who believe that Josana Tabor was wrongfully decided, or wrongly decided, that the fact of the matter is, is that that is not really an issue, because whether you believe that Josana Tabor was decided correctly or not, it was decided and it was decided 9-0, so it is the law of the land.",0.0
False,,"As an aside, it's one of the few cases on an issue that was potentially divisive but turned out not to be divisive, where there was unanimity. If you look at many of the cases that come up, including the same-sex marriage cases, they tend to be 4-5, so this was very unusual, to have all nine justices agree on something.",0.0
False,,Now there are some that say what Josana Tabor does is that it permits unlawful discrimination and that's not true. And the reason that that's not true is because the ministerial exception is just a form of an exemption. And all of the statutes that we deal with have exemptions.,0.0
False,,"Government employees are exempted from the Fair Employment and Housing Act. Airlines are exempted from the National Labor Relations Act. Agricultural employees are exempted from a lot of laws. So what that means is that the Legislature, in most cases, has determined that we're gonna enact a law.",0.0
False,,"It's gonna say some things are discriminatory but we are going to specifically exempt people and we're going to let those people engage in acts that we're not gonna let others engage in, so all Josana Tabor is a constitutionally required exemption.",0.0
False,,"So if you look at that that way, then you're not looking at the employer engaging in unlawful discrimination because there's no law that applies to them. They have just a exception or an exemption. The ministerial exemption or exception has a stronger basis then the statutory exemptions.",0.0
False,,"The statutory exemptions are voted by legislators. They sometimes are changed, things are added, things are taken away. But this exception, or exemption, is constitutionally compelled and can't be changed by any Legislature, whether it's the state Legislature or the federal government.",0.0
False,,"Now the purpose of the religious schools is obviously to teach, but it's also to foster spiritual growth to inculcate religious beliefs and values and to help the student grow as a person intellectually and spiritually.",0.0
False,,"They have in common with the public schools the basic education, but they are much different than the public schools because of the spiritual factor that they try to inculcate in their students. The schools are parts of the church.",0.0
False,,"They are an integral part of the religion that sponsors the various schools. And the teachers have to at least respect the beliefs of the school and of the religion in order to be effective role models. As a matter of fact, in some of the schools, depending on what religious tradition you're from, it's an act of proselytization.",0.0
False,,"So it's not just to make people good students and to bring them closer to the religion, but to take other people who are not members of the religion and make them part of the religion. So I've been in many, many Third World countries, and as you go around to those Third World countries you see many of our religious organizations establishing schools there and the purpose is to proselytize and to bring new members in.",0.0
False,,"Now the different religions have different views, but they are all fairly consistent. And I just wanna read what some of the major, mainstream religions say about the role of their schools. Because I've said that yes, they have a spiritual function, but you don't wanna believe a lawyer, obviously.",0.0
False,,"Wanna hear what the religions have to say. So what the Lutherans say is that we have educators who model spiritual leadership. They study God's word. They share their personal faith story. They apply the law and the gospel, and they equip the students to act courageously and to be God's people for service and care of others.",0.0
False,,"The Baptists. One of the factors that distinguishes a Christian college from a secular institution is the attention given to and the value placed on spiritual growth. That colleges and universities that emphasize spiritual growth and development alongside intellectual and professional growth will be places where a student stands the best chance of becoming all God wants him or her to be, the Adventist.",0.0
False,,"Education in it's broadest sense is a means of returning human beings to their original relationship with God. The aim of true education is to restore human beings into the image of God. So when teachers take these positions, they are fully aware of the religious nature of the school and they know what to expect.",0.0
False,,"I'm a lawyer. When I became the lawyer and I joined my law firm I knew what to expect. If I am a student who is looking to go to school, I go on the school's website and I read what the school has to say about itself, I know what to expect.",0.0
False,,"If I am an applicant for employment to be a teacher at a religious school, I look on the website and I know what to expect. The rules are there, the faith based nature of the school is there. Now the term minister has been applied broadly, more than just an ordained minister or a credentialed minister.",0.0
False,,"It's been applied by the various courts and this was not in Los taper to music directors, choir directors, seminarians who engaged in maintenance, administrators, a kosher supervisor, and of course like in Hosana Tabor, to teachers.",0.0
False,,"So the ministerial exemption is something that is broader than what we consider to be a traditional minister, or credential minister or chapel. Now if you look at Hosanna Tabor. Hosanna Tabor according to the court spent most of her time teaching.",0.0
False,,"Yet, it's concluded based upon the facts, that she had enough function speaking for the church, that she came under the exception. And Alito and Kagan in their concurring opinion acknowledged that teachers of the faith can qualify as ministers.",0.0
False,,"So we've got a specific ruling of the Supreme Court applying to one teacher. And we've got two of the more liberal justices acknowledging that teachers of the faith, in the abstract, can qualify for the ministerial exception.",0.0
False,,"And as you probably know, the ministerial exception has been long standing in California, much before Josanna Tabor and the Chapman University case and also in the Red Hill case. Now, teachers qualify for the ministerial exception because they are role models and they fulfill the religious mission of the school.",0.0
False,,"And this is something that we call faith integration. And in many of the religious schools, probably most of the religious schools there is an effort to integrate faith into the classroom. And this is a hard concept to understand. So, if you look at Biola University, which is a non-denominational Christian University.",0.0
False,,"They say, describing the Anthropology Department that the anthropology major seeks to provide a holistic understanding of the diversity of human behavior across time and culture, through a distinctly Christian worldview. Why choose chemistry at Biola? The reason is we integrate Biblical training and Christian perspective with science.",0.0
False,,"And you can look at many of the other schools, the religious schools, right on their websites. And you can see that when they describe the most basic of courses, the science courses or the history courses, they're talking about that this is not the same kind of class that you're gonna get at the University of California.",0.0
False,,"That this is a class which is gonna be infused with religion. If you go to the Azusa Pacific University website, which is a nondenominational evangelical University in Southern California, you'll see that they have an entire office of faith integration.",0.0
False,,"And they have a faculty faith integration handbook, which is 81 pages long, which tells the faculty members as to what they're supposed to do to bring faith into the class. Even into classes that have topics that most of us would never think would have any faith based aspects of it.",0.0
False,,"So, if you look at their faculty handbook, and this is separate from their faith based handbook, it says that faith integration is informed reflection on and discovery of Christian faith within the academic disciplines. And it's in order to advance the work of God in the world.",0.0
False,,"So what we have is we've got people who some of us may think of as just teaching normal topics, like history or geology or something that would have no faith counterpart. But we see that the Christian schools and the other religious schools believe that their purpose is to infuse religion into the classroom.",0.0
False,,"And you've got the teachers being responsible for being the spokespeople or the spokesperson for the religion. Now, it is well- Hope that was okay to say bless you, given the topic. Gesundheit. That it's been constitutionally recognized for a long time, even before Hosanna-Tabor, that a religious institution has the right to select its own ministers, and that this is constitutionally compelled.",0.0
False,,"And under the Hosanna-Tabor case, it's not only the establishment clauses and the free exercise clause, but it's freedom of Association. And if you read Hosanna-Tabor, this concept of being able to designate your own spokesman of your religion and religious autonomy goes back to the Magna Carta.",0.0
False,,"So it's not something that we made up when we put together our constitution. It goes back to England, well before we were a country. And in Hosanna-Tabor it became clear that the government can't dictate matters of church governments. The government can't dictate who's gonna speak for the church.",0.0
False,,"The government can't dictate the church's mission. That the church has the right to decide who who will carry its beliefs to the others. And as much as a legislative body, be it state or federal, might want to extend anti-discrimination to areas where the ministerial exception will apply, that's constitutionally prohibited.",0.0
False,,"It just can't be done. Now, the majority in Hosanna-Tabor looked at the facts. They said we're not gonna give you a bright line test. And Professor Griffin noted that too. They looked at a whole lot of facts involving the plaintiff in that case. Justice Thomas, in his own concurring opinion, came up with a test.",0.0
False,,"His test was that the exception applies to schools that consider teachers as a minister. And Alito and Kagan, in the other concurring opinion, noted that ordination was not required. But that what they said to do is to look at the teacher's duties. And those be critical, whether they're critical in performing the mission and spreading the message of the group.",0.0
False,,"There is in labor law, because remember I'm just a labor lawyer. There is a concept that we have called the University of Great Falls, Montana. And the University of Great Falls, Montana is a NLRB case involving assertion of jurisdiction over religious schools. And the US Supreme Court has said that the NLRB cannot do that.",0.0
False,,"And the NLRB has disregarded that, and they've gone up to the circuit several times. And in Great Falls, what the courts said, the DC circuit that's been followed, is that what we're gonna do to determine whether a school is religious or not. And whether they fall under what's called the Catholic Bishop of Chicago Exception Case.",0.0
False,,"It's like an exemption, but it's not. It's constitutionally required, like Hosanna-Tabor is. That what we're gonna do is we cannot troll through the religious beliefs of the school. We can't go in there with a shovel and start digging around to see, really, how religious are they?",0.0
False,,"What we're gonna do is we are going to look at how does the school hold itself out. And if the school holds itself out as being religious, we are not gonna look behind there. And I would suggest that the same standards should be for the ministerial exception.",0.0
False,,"That you take the DC Circuit case in Great Falls, which says you can't troll through their beliefs. We're gonna have to take as faith what they say. And that you apply it in this context too. Now, in summary then, the Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that religious schools have the right to designate who's a minister, who performs their ministerial function, including teachers. And that any effort to deprive them of that right is barred by the first amendment. Thank you very much for your time.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, if I could start somewhere, please? First of all, You're not looking to see whether somebody is a minister. You're looking to see whether they qualify for the ministerial exception.",0.0
False,,"I think the way that the court looks at it is somebody that has as part of their duties, the curating of the message of the particular religion.",0.0
False,,"I said that those are courses that most of us who went to public school, wouldn't think would be faith-based, but faith-based schools bring faith into those kinds of classes.",0.0
False,,You're asking the wrong person because I only went to public school. But I think-,0.0
False,,"The legal distinction would be even if you offer up both sides of the debate that you are advocating one side of the debate. So there are certain religions that believe that the Earth was created relatively recently, as opposed to billions of years ago.",0.0
False,,"So that that would be a History of the Earth 101 class. They would say what the other side says, but they would come to a conclusion that, no, that's not correct.",0.0
False,,"Can I point out, excuse me. Go ahead. You're on the diocese so you get to go first.",0.0
False,,"Okay. I don't pretend to be an expert in accreditation standards, even though I did go to the UC system. But we have clients that actually wrestle with these kinds of issues when it comes to getting government money. And we have clients that, I've talked to them, and they have made conscious decisions to pass up on government money, because of some of the strings that are attached to the government money.",0.0
False,,"And that would prohibit them from being able to practice their religion as they see, and get the money. So I don't know about the UC accreditation standards, but I do know that at least my clients do anguish over this issue.",0.0
False,,"They're not trying to have it all. And we've got that situation going on now, where there's an issue of federal bond funding, or state bond funding. And we have a client that may have to give up $165 million, because it's too religious.",0.0
False,,"And it's prepared to give up $165 million if it's too religious because it's gonna stay religious. The other point that I'd like to make and I think that Michael's experience is the same as mine. I've handled hundreds of cases, maybe thousands of cases in the last 45 years for all kinds of employers, including religious employers.",0.0
False,,"In the number of times that the ministerial exception has come up, you could count on less than one hand. I have a case now involving a hospital chaplain. There's not going to be too much argument that that person was a minister.",0.0
False,,"I had another case that was involving a school and it was a person who was an ordained minister and was in the theology department. But other than those two cases, I can't think of any other ministerial exception case that I've handled. And if I haven't handled it, probably nobody in my firm has handled it. So this is not something that happens everyday.",0.0
False,,"If I could make two points. There was one point that seems to come from both sides to me. And that is that all the students aren't of the denomination and all of the faculty are not of the denomination. The California Supreme Court, I think two cases, has rejected that notion as being relevant with respect to religious status. And that's the McKean case and the Kelly case. Those are hospital cases, and they were FEHA exemption cases. And the question was whether they qualified for the religious employer exemption? And the plaintiff said well wait a minute, all of their students, or all of their patients are not Catholic or not Methodist. And all of their employees are not Catholic or Methodist. And the Supreme Court, in both cases, said it doesn't really matter. The other thing is that Smith is really not necessarily the silver bullet. I understand Smith, good generalized rules, general aplicability.",0.0
False,,"But that doesn't give you the right necessarily to legislate a law. Say for example, outlawing morality clauses. And the reason is because if Smith were the law and overrode the ministerial exception, you wouldn't have Hosanah tabled. There you were dealing with a law of general aplicability, the Americans with Disabilities Act. And that law general applicability all to Smith, had to give way to the constitutional rights of the employer and Hosannah Tabled.",0.0
False,,"And teachers that are teaching appropriate coursework would say that, you know. There are some people that believe that the Earth is 5 billion years old, but we don't believe that, and here's why.",0.0
False,,Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans or CAHP. Thank you for inviting me to talk to the Committee about how I spent my summer recess. A lot of it was spent on this issue.,0.0
False,,"By way of background, CAHP represents 46 Knox-Keene licensed health plans under the Department of Managed Healthcare. Our members come in all shapes and sizes. Some of them are nonprofits. Many of them are public, and many of them are private organizations that collectively provide healthcare to about 28 million Californians or about 95% of the healthcare coverage market in the state.",0.0
False,,More than half of our plans participate in the Medi-Cal Managed Care Program in some form or another and we value our partnership with the State of California.,0.0
False,,Today our Medi-Cal Managed Care plans pay the existing iteration of the Managed Care Organization or MCO tax. And because the existing tax is limited to the Medi-Cal plans it does not raise taxes on individuals or employer purchases of coverage.,0.0
False,,"Of course, several things have changed since the original MCO tax was enacted. Number one, the healthy families program no longer exists and that program has been folded into Medi-Cal. The state's entitlement program for lower income Californians, and the MCO tax was in essence transferred to support Medi-Cal as a result.",0.0
False,,"And number two, and more relevant to our discussion today as we've been talking about the federal government has issued guidance suggesting that California's per MCO tax does not currently meet it's parameters. Among other things the MCO tax must be brought into all health plans not just Medi-Cal plans to meet federal guidelines.",0.0
False,,This means that for the first time individuals and employers paying healthcare coverage in the private markets are now being asked by this federal guidance to pay the cost of an MCO tax if it was enacted to meet those parameters. And this last point is important because it embodies really the reason that we're all here.,0.0
False,,"We're not here because of anything the administration has done. We're not here because of anything the Legislature has done. And we're certainly not here because of anything the health plans have done. We're here because for years the federal government matched with federal dollars the existing version of the MCO tax, thus in essence deeming it compliant and now it's changed its mind and it wants all plants to pay the tax.",0.0
False,,"So therefore under the new federal construct the MCO tax is now a health care coverage affordability issue for the first time which is challenging, but despite this challenge and this new reality, our trade association believes that California's existing MCO tax provides important financial support to Medi-Cal, which is why we made the decision to work constructively within our membership with the administration and with the Legislature to find an alternative tax if it exists that can fill the hole in the Medi-Cal budget and garner a broad based health plan support in process.",0.0
False,,"Number one, you don't have to tax managed care plans under these rules. There are a list of 19 classes of taxable entities that could be considered as a part of a federal Medicaid provider tax.",0.0
False,,"So using what we learned we did start to construct and test certain models. We looked at flat taxes, we looked at tiered taxes, we looked at enrollment based taxes, we looked at revenue, primarily using at first publicly available data.",0.0
False,,"We initially modeled 21 different versions of an MCO tax, and each time we ran into the same issues. One model would achieve equitability but was not affordable. Other tax constructs could be made less expensive to the private markets, but at the expense of fairness in the tax structure.",0.0
False,,So at a certain point in time we felt it was time to get creative and what we've done is we've asked for more refined data directly from our health plan membership in order to test a new round of models that we hope can better align with the principles that we laid out.,0.0
False,,"Of course, this process takes time. Many of the plans felt that the data that we were asking for was proprietary so we had to ensure the sensitive handling of plan data and we have not concluded the process of our latest round of modeling as of yet.",0.0
False,,"I think in short, the task of creating an alternative MCO tax is made very difficult by the constraints of the federal guidance and as I stated, a solution that meets our goals has yet to emerge from the efforts that we have embarked on, but as I indicated, we are currently in the middle of one such process.",0.0
False,,"Fortunately, the federal government is allowing states to keep their current MCO tax in place until the end of their respective legislative session. This give California all of 2015 and 2016, to find an alternative to the tax that is equitable, supports Medi-Cal and is affordable.",0.0
False,,"In the meantime, the current MCO tax remains in place generating revenue and does not expire until 2016. That doesn't say if a solution unveiled itself next week, that we shouldn't do that, but we haven't found a solution at this time and it's just important to understand that the federal government deems current MCO taxes in compliance until the end of session and I think others, and we would agree with that and interpret that to mean the end of a two year session if your session is two years.",0.0
False,,"So I would just quickly close by say that we do appreciate that this Committee is attempting to tackle a very complex equation to ensure that the safety net stays whole, while also protecting affordability for small businesses and employers.",0.0
False,,Health plans have been and continue to work hard to find the right calculation that can achieve all of our goals. We do look forward to continue our work with the administration and we've had some positive discussions there so that we can continue our efforts. Thank you very much.,0.0
False,,"Right. No, thank you for that question. Currently, all current taxes and fees are a component of health plan premiums and we would expect that to continue with anything that was added by the Legislature.",0.0
False,,"It'd be very difficult to absorb a tax of this size depending on what was passed by the Legislature. Just by way of example, one of the problems that we did see with the administration's proposal was that for certain mid size commercial plans the burden of that tax is very high and for one of them it actually doubled the amount of tax that it owed to the State of California.",0.0
False,,So it would be very difficult to just absorb that level of taxation. So those are costs that are gonna have to be borne somewhere in the healthcare system.,0.0
False,,"I don't have a precise number. Our play- It's kind of a- We estimate that 28 million lives are covered DMHC products. About 10 million of those or so, are Medi-Cal Managed Care, so your would subtract those lives. But I don't have a finite number for you, but we can work on that.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, so must directly benefit the Medi-Cal program, be equitable to the payers of the tax, and consider affordability to purchasers.",0.0
False,,Affordability to purchasers.,0.0
False,,"Obviously, the plans are gonna have to make a determination about what they deem affordable to their individual purchasers of health care whether those be individuals or employers.",0.0
False,,"We do believe that the publicly available proposals that we've analyzed hit the commercial markets in the neighborhood of hundreds of millions of dollars in aggregate total taxes to the private sector. For example, the administration's proposal in January pegged it at the commercial cost to be about $650 million to private payers.",0.0
False,,"That's with the tiers, yeah. And then as stated by the LAO. Could go up another $300 million. Yeah, it could go up.",0.0
False,,"So that is an amount of taxation that obviously is gonna be as we said, it's gonna factor into healthcare affordability and cost and certain employers that employ about 200 people or more, already see their taxes in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars.",0.0
False,,"Of course, the employees pay a part of that, and the employers pay a part of that, but to have that aggregate number laid on top of what's already paid is a problem. So the trick is to see if you can lower it to an absorbable amount. Obviously the employer community is gonna have something to say about that a well.",0.0
False,,"So I can't give you a certain number of what that would mean, but it would have to be taken into context of all of our other principles and all other factors that would be in the mix.",0.0
False,,"I hope this answers your question. The latest figures that come to mind are the figures that I saw breaking down according to what the MLR requires, and so the 2014 data that comes to mind is that in 2014, about $116 billion were paid in health care claims in the State of California. There were about $12 billion in administrative expenses reported and profits were about 3%. So I don't know if that helps you answer your question.",0.0
False,,"Yeah. Yep. Payments. But let me verify that, hold on. Yeah, in 2014 it was reported that total plan revenue was $136 billion. A $116 of that went to direct care out on claims.",0.0
False,,The total planned revenue for 2014.,0.0
False,,I don't know the answer to that. I'm sorry. I will have to back and check that.,0.0
False,,I could verify that and touch base with you later.,0.0
False,,"I mean, okay, we'll go with that assumption. I was a poly-sci major for a reason",0.0
False,,"They can be, we don't think it's impossible and we didn't enter-",0.0
False,,"Yeah, I mean we didn't enter our project with any perceived or preconceived notion about possibility, impossibility, inevitability, or other types of concepts that we felt would bog down our work. I think they are possible.",0.0
False,,"The problem is, you know, can you pass the B1, B2 math test? And so, I think that is the real question. If this was a policy or political exercise, it'd be a lot easier to construct something. So, I think, you know, taken with the concept of the various federal requirements, which are hard, and have to be overcome, you know, I wouldn't say that we would, that our principles are incompatible at all.",0.0
False,,"Well, we think about another-",0.0
False,,So the work that we're doing right now will probably yield another 9 to 12 different things to look at.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, and I think when you look at a, you know, potential hit to the commercial markets that totals in the hundreds of millions of dollars, it's hard to find, you know, one policy issue that's going to basically allow a plan to make up that size of a tax hit.",0.0
False,,"And then you also have to consider that, you know, it's not the plans that are paying, it's the employer community, as well. I think that becomes a pretty complex discussion. Obviously, health plans are facing a lot of costs in the healthcare system these days. Rising drug costs is a really big problem in the pricing of drugs.",0.0
False,,"You know, provider consolidation is an issue and particularly the level of outer network activity and those costs that are born in the healthcare system are a problem, as well. So, I mean, sure, there are things to look at, but there's not just one thing that would, you know, total $650 million.",0.0
False,,"But there's certainly some efficiences in the system, you know, that are important to take a look at and then, you know, as we are doing this Committee all the time, or in the regular session version of this Committee all the time, new mandates and legislation raises the cost of healthcare, as well. So, you know, we just wanna be mindful of those things.",0.0
False,,"Well, did you mean the MCO tax?",0.0
False,,"Yeah, I think, well, so let me clarify. You know, the reason we stated that in our letter, we think it's a statement of fact. The Federal Government is allowing states until the end of the respective legislative sessions to solve this.",0.0
False,,"The only thing I would say is, yes, I mean, not having the certainty of revenue, if we are going to rely on this revenue, can be an issue in rate development, not just for the Medi-Cal plans, but for the private market.",0.0
False,,"Ideally if we were going to go in this direction, you'd want to have some certainty about that. I don't think that we would disagree with that notion, but we think more problems are created if we rush through a bad version of this tax.",0.0
False,,"So that's primarily why we feel that some caution needs to be exercised and the time should be used, as much time to think through a workable solution that can garner support from our entire industry.",0.0
False,,"I think the order, yeah",0.0
False,,"Sure, and what we have is our letter, and we do make reference to that in our letter, in the third paragraph.",0.0
False,,To the customers. Yeah.,0.0
False,,"And indeed, CAHP was a strong supporter of the current MCO tax when it was originally passed in, I believe 2009, to help save the healthy families program which was an insurance based program for children that enjoyed bipartisan support in the Legislature.",0.0
False,,"Number two, you don't have to tax enrollment. In other words, there are other units of taxation that could be considered as a part of your construct like revenue as has been discussed.",0.0
False,,"And number three, it quickly dawned upon us that this is more than a policy or political exercise. It's really an exercise in math, if you want to deviate in any way away from the basic perimeters of the federal rules there's certain statistical equations that have to be satisfied particularly on the issue of uniformity which has already been discussed at this hearing.",0.0
False,,"I think it's all plans but I'll have to verify that, yeah.",0.0
False,,"Okay, thanks. Mike Robeson on behalf of the Glass Packaging Institute. Really quickly, appreciate the Select Committee convening. Appreciate the members sitting through the hearing and caring about this issue. I really wanna just quickly concur with some of the remarks that Mark Murray made concerning the bottle bill program. And the glass container industry has historically supported. Expansion of the program to include all containers that are carrying beverages that are already in the program, basically leveling the playing field between container types.",0.0
False,,"We think that's an appropriate expansion of the program, and I really just wanna limit my comments to that, and hope to work with this Committee and the policy committees in the future on any legislation that deals with the bottle program. Thanks.",0.0

False,,"And on a fiscal note I just would like to point out that to the extent that the students are earning the college credits in high school, that's just the state paying it forward, so to speak, because the state then is not paying for those credits in year one or year two out from high school. And to the extent that those students are transferring to a CSU, the state is actually saving money on those units because it's more expensive to educate a student as CSU than at a community college.

False,,"Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association, we are a co-sponsor. Charter schools are public schools, the bill simply clarifies that like all other public schools a charter school governing board should open up those meeting to the public, because they get tax funding.",0.0
False,,"They should also make sure that how they're spending those tax dollars are available through the Public Records Act and because they're here to serve the public should not have conflicts of interest on their board. We do thank Committee staff for the analysis, but would point out charter schools are reimbursed for state mandates.",0.0
False,,Lots of districts use the block grant to get their mandates reimbursed. It's a quick efficient process. We look forward to working with you and urge your support when AB 709 comes off of suspense. Thanks.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association Advocates. Three quick points. I only had two until Mr. Bramble spoke, so I need to add three. The first one in response to what Mr. Bramble said, we do not get mandate reimbursements. School districts can get mandate reimbursements.",0.0
False,,"They cannot get them for charter schools, they can get them for themselves. One of the points that the consultant made in the analysis, which absolutely right on. We don't receive mandate reimbursements, but we do suffer the costs associated with those mandates. It would still be a mandate, we would have to take the money out of the classroom in order to provide the services necessary under this bill.",0.0
False,,"And lastly, I'd just like to point out for the members of the Committee that there is a deal to be had on this bill. We've been dealing with this issue for a very, very long time and it's time to put it to bed. California charter schools actually supports three quarters of the bill.",0.0
False,,"We support the Brown Act, we support the Public Records Act, we support the Political Reform Act. We just don't support 1090. The language that we would support has been shared with your staff, Mr. Chair and with the author's office. We hope you will consider it. It will do several things. One, it would get CCSA in support of the bill.",0.0

False,,"Our members come in all shapes and sizes. Our health plans are public, not for profit, more private organizations. And they collectively provide health care to just about 28 million Californians, or about 95% of the health care coverage market in the state.",0.0
False,,More than half of our plans participate in the Medi-Cal managed care program in one form or another. And our plans certainly value the partnership that we have with the Department of Health Care Services. And we agree with the administration that finding a replacement for the existing MCO tax is an important priority. Today our Medi-Cal plans pay the existing iteration of the MCO tax that has been discussed already today.,0.0

Among other things, our MCO tax must be broadened to all health plans, not just the Medi-Cal plans.",0.0
False,,"And this means that for the first time, individuals and employers paying healthcare coverage in the private markets are now being asked to pay the cost of an MCO tax. If we enacted a new one, that meets Federal guidelines. I just want to emphasize this last point is important because it embodies the reason that we're really here.",0.0

False,,"That can fill the hole in the Medi-Cal budget and garner broad-based health plan support. In December of 2014, our board, CAHP's Board of Directors created a workgroup for plan experts and consultants to determine whether a tax can be constructed that meets certain guiding principles.",0.0
False,,"The principles that define our work are pretty straight forward. We believe that among other things, any new tax must directly benefit the MedipCal program, be equitable to the payers of the tax, and consider affordability to the purchasers of health care coverage. We believe that if you're going to tax people who are doing the right thing in buying coverage, either for themselves or their employees.",0.0
False,,"That the money should go directly back into improving the healthcare system in California. Affordability is also important, because millions of Californians receive coverage through their employer or purchase it on their own. Private purchasers of coverage today are already paying higher taxes due to the imposition of what's called the health insurance tax that was part of the Affordable Care Act.",0.0
False,,"In addition, large purchasers of healthcare coverage are facing the excise tax, commonly referred to as the Cadillac tax, on higher benefit plans, if you will, which kicks in in 2018. So that's on the horizon as a new tax for coverage.",0.0
False,,"So we feel that the health plans, purchasers and policy makers have to be sensitive about adding new taxes to health insurance that will only make it more difficult for people to purchase health coverage. Taxes and fees already represent a pretty significant percentage of the premium dollar.",0.0
False,,"Back to our workgroup and its efforts. Our workgroup organized and then exhausted the first part of 2015, analyzing the administration's January MCO tax proposal. Upon analysis, we recommended to the budget sub committees of the houses to reject the administration's proposal. The proposed tax did not meet the principles that we laid out.",0.0
False,,"And therefore, cannot garner a broad base support within our trade Association and I wanna be sensitive to the difficulties of constructing a new MCO tax and that's not a criticism of the administration. This is very hard work and very complicated work. In any case, soon afterwards CAP, working with our partners at LHPC or the local health plans of California began, really at square one, on developing a better understanding of what the federal Medicaid provider tax rules really say.",0.0
False,,"And identifying areas of flexibility within those rules that might lead to a better result. We learned many interesting things. Number one, you don't have to tax managed care plans under these rules.",0.0
False,,"They're a list of 19 classes of taxable entities that can be considered. Number two, you don't have to tax enrollment and the administration's proposal was enrollment based. But in other words, there are other units of measurement, if you will that can be taxed like revenue and number three that this is more than a policy or a political exercise.",0.0
False,,"It's really an exercise in math, which has been challenging and I like to say, I was a poli-sci major for a reason. It was a math avoidance decision on my part.",0.0
False,,"But in any case, in order to deviate from the uniformity rules of the federal tax guidance, you must pass a mathematical equation or CMS will not approve any tiered structure, if you will, unless it passes a math test called the B1, B2 test, which is very complicated. So, I'll save that for any questions.",0.0
False,,"Using what we've learned though, in really studying up on the federal rules, we started constructing and testing models. We looked at flat taxes, we looked at tiered taxes, we looked at an enrollment basis, we looked at revenue basis.",0.0
False,,"Primarily at first, using publicly available data. In all, we initially modeled 21 different versions of an MCO tax. And each time, we ran into the same issues. One model would achieve equitability, that was not affordable.",0.0
False,,"Other tax constructs could be made slightly less expensive to the private markets, but at the expense of fairness in the structure of the tax and lead to the same sort of market dysfunctions that were inherent in the administration's proposal in January. So at this point, we do feel that it's time to get creative and we're asking for more refined data directly from our member plans in order to test a new round of models that may better align with our adopted principles.",0.0
False,,"At this point, we are currently in the middle of that process and project. I think one of my main points that we wanna leave the Committee with is that the task of creating an alternative MCO tax is made difficult by the constraints of the federal guidance.",0.0
False,,"And a solution that meets our goals regrettably has yet to emerge from our efforts. But as I indicated, we are in the middle of a newer process. Fortunately, the federal government is allowing states to keep their current MCO tax structure in place until the end of their respective legislative sessions.",0.0
False,,"This gives California all of 2015 and 2016 to find an alternative to the MCO tax that is equitable, supports MediCal and is affordable. In the meantime, the current MCO tax remains in place generating revenue that does not expire until 2016. Now having said that, that doesn't mean if a solution presents itself earlier than that we shouldn't take that opportunity. But we also shouldn't rush into a bad version of this tax that could be expensive for folks that have to pay for their healthcare.",0.0
False,,"So, I'll leave it at that. And I just wanna close by saying that we're working and this is very complicated business, we look forward to keep our connections with the administration and we've had several positive conversations with them and this Committee as our work moves forward. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Yeah. I mean, there's nothing inherently, how do I wanna say this? There's nothing inherently wrong with any construct of the tax, but they do contain certain tendencies, I guess. So you could do something that's a flat tax, which is something that's being proposed in the Legislature.",0.0
False,,"What we found in examining that structure is that there's a tradeoff on affordability vis-a-vis the commercial markets. In order to raise the same amount of revenue, you would have to increase the burden of the tax on the commercial markets in order to achieve the same amount of revenue is what we found in our analysis.",0.0
False,,"And really the reason for that is one of the theories behind the administrations proposal, a tiered tax was that if they created the tiers in a certain manner. I think what they were trying to do is place all of the MediCal plans in the highest tax tier, so that you could really leverage and maximize the federal dollars that you could obtain from CMS.",0.0
False,,"And the MediCal plans, because they're paid on an actuarial basis. See those costs reflected in the reimbursement rates from the state. So having them here and a particular commercial plan here is not necessarily a problem.",0.0
False,,"But if you flatten the tax, you have to move the commercial plans up here. And so that means you have to raise more money from the private markets in order to raise the same amount of revenue. So that's a tradeoff and the tradeoff with the tiered tax is though, although you might wanna try to leverage more federal dollars out of the Medicaid plans just by basis of a plan's enrollment size.",0.0
False,,"A problem that we saw with the administrations proposals is that we have a handful of mid-sized commercial plans that have absolutely no MediCal business, but by virtue of enrollment. They were placed in the highest tax tier. So that means, and they're competing in the same markets as these larger plans, so that is an inherent problem in that structure.",0.0
False,,"So, is there a way to resolve those issues? We're trying, what I do wanna emphasize again is that this isn't a political exercise, a mathematical exercise. You can vary from the federal rules, but you can only do so, if you meet certain statistical tests. And if you don't, they'll reject the tax.",0.0
False,,So that's an issue.,0.0
False,,"I mean, our work group efforts have been focused on what we can do in the managed care universe. But as you stated, there are 19 classes of providers or entities that could be taxed and have that tax revenue be matched by the federal government. Currently, California does three of them.",0.0
False,,"We have the MCO tax, which is found non-compliant with federal rules. We do the hospital tax and we do skilled nursing facilities. There are 16 other classes that could be considered. Those haven't been considered as a part of our work group.",0.0
False,,"As the trade association group for the managed care plans and payers, if you will. This portion of our membership paying the current MCO tax. A constructive avenue was to look at models that require the participation of our members. And obviously, we can't compel the participation of other entities to participate in our work group.",0.0
False,,"So at this point, our modeling is based on health plans.",0.0
False,,"I mean, the only thing I can provide there, Mr. Chair, is that the hospital community, obviously, has a lot of experience on this issue and we've been talking to them just to get insight on their experience. And there's definitely some shared war stories, but there are a lot of differences between our industries as well. So we have a unique set of problems and questions that we have to answer.",0.0
False,,"I'm happy to forward you the list. I mean, you could do services on immediate, I'm just gonna read from the list, if you don't mind.",0.0
False,,And obviously you know we're not endorsing any of this. But as an objective response I just want to be clear. Cause I could walk into this audience and get hammered.,0.0
False,,"No, but objectively the list of permissible classes include dental services, podiatry, chiropractic, optimetric, psychological, therapy, emergency ambulance services. I think some of these have already been considered in past budget deliberations.",0.0
False,,"Physician services, home healthcare, outpatient, prescription drugs, and the list goes on. But yeah, they're located within the federal rules.",0.0
False,,Thank you.,0.0
False,,Thank you very much.,0.0
False,,"Yeah. Obviously, it depends on which path you take. We you know we do have some numbers. Like you know for instance you know the per member per month impacts of the governor's proposal. You know the premium, the hit to a commercial payer and I'll define as a health plan for the purposes of this discussion.",0.0
False,,"Can range anywhere from $0.75 per member per month to $25.25 per member per month. So, obviously, we're a family of five in my house, so if our premiums went up $25 per person, that's $125, potentially.",0.0
False,,"In increased premiums, and you can extrapolate that out through further years. So that gives you an idea. I mean, the only other thing I'll say, Mister Chair, is that these types of taxes and fees are reflected currently in the premiums.",0.0
False,,"It's very difficult to absorb the entire cost of this within the plan, especially since one proposal actually doubles one of my plans' entire obligation to the state. They can't just write that off, so it's an affordability issue.",0.0
False,,I think when you look at aggregate costs. You know the $650 million that would result as a part of the January proposal is significant. I think you know there was an argument that was made yesterday in the Senate Committee that this is really just 1%. This is really just a 1% tax across the board.,0.0
False,,And we would argue that 1% is a significant percentage.,0.0
False,,"When you consider all the cost pressures that we're currently facing in the health care system, so.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, no, I thank you, Assemblyman, for that question. I mean our operating principals are pretty simple. They're Any MCO tax, the revenue generated has to go back into the Medi-Cal program, number one.",0.0
False,,"It has to be equitable to the payers of the tax, and it needs to consider affordability to the purchasers. And so, our, we didn't enter this project with any preconceived notion about whether the achievement of a new MCO tax was possible, or impossible, or even inevitable. I think we didn't wanna bog our process down early on with those existential questions, if you will.",0.0
False,,"We really wanna see what's possible. And we don't think that achieving those goals is impossible within the federal guidelines, as long as you're meeting the mathematical tests. But on the specific elements, affordability is a big one, since people have to afford to buy our coverage.",0.0
False,,And the goal there is really to minimize the impact on the commercial markets as much as possible. And then I think the employer community and the plans are going to have to determine whether any cost is worth the purported benefits of the tax.,0.0
False,,"Right, there are many states that are wrestling with this issue Just by way of example, we've been in touch with the Michigan Association of Health Plans and our counterparts in Pennsylvania, those are two states that are wrestling with this question, interestingly enough, their legislators are petitioning CMS to continue their existing MCO taxes.",0.0
False,,"It'll be interesting to see how successful those efforts are. One state, Michigan for example, tried an MCO tax based on claims data. They have a fundamentally different private market than we do in California.",0.0
False,,"Ours is more capitated where the plans pay a per member, per month capitated rate to the medical groups. That take on the risk. Risk is not allowed, risk is only allowed for the health plans' security not the providers' so they're more of a fee per service claims based market so that works for them.",0.0

Additionally, when it comes to our engineering staff, what we're looking at in the capital outlay support program is it's not just about construction, we have environmental, we have right of way, we have design, there are many different components that come with the project delivering capital outlay program.",0.0

False,,"I do know how to project it, attrition rate, but I can tell you over the past five years, our average annual attrition rate has been 3.2%, so it is less than the 5% number.",0.0

Now we're contracting out, specifically what we're looking at when we're contracting out is we're looking at geographical flexibility.",0.0

Three that will serve the general veteran population and 13 projects that have VHHP supported housing. Along with other general veteran and non-VHHP funded units.

So we've really front loaded the first couple of rounds to ensure that we're meeting the targets. 32 total application were received requesting approximately $125 million.",0.0
False,,"Given the demand for the program in the first round, we were asked to address the barriers in awarding the total $75 million in funding this round. So I'll speak to that for just a moment. The barriers really are the result of the unique and new characteristics of the program. Obviously, we went from zero to program guidelines in a very short period of time.",0.0
False,,"In order to tailor a project to meet the guideline requirements, folks really needed more time to kind of assess the project, and get the partnerships in place, that the guidelines required. Not to mention the complexity of some of the partnerships that needed to be created, and the relationships that needed to be created between the service providers and the housing developers that are in some cases, non-traditional.",0.0
False,,"We actually did extensive outreach, stakeholder outreach, before the first round, and we actually did hear from a lot of potential applicants as well as actual applicants that they didn't anticipate either applying this round or they knew that they weren't gonna be competitive this round, but they were gonna apply anyway. And so ultimately, some of the folks that did apply that were in that category of really not thinking they would be competitive, really just wanted to cut a test their projects against it. And ultimately, we after scoring the projects, we felt we really did come up with a set of 17 projects that were exemplary in terms of providing the type of housing and the type of services that we really wanted to see.",0.0
False,,"We would anticipate though going forward, as people have the opportunity as the project sponsors have the opportunity to really strengthen the partnerships to really familiarize themselves with the guidelines and to tailor their projects for what the guidelines are asking for that we'll see fuller utilization of the funds.",0.0
False,,"Let me just speak to quickly another factor there. All but one unsuccessful applicant lost substantial points in the category that had to do with the rental and operating subsidies, as has been mentioned. This is one of the places where there is a challenge. Other areas where scores tended to be low or the quality of supportive service plans, project readiness, and the experience of the lead service provider and so those were some other areas where folks lost a substantial number of points.",0.0
False,,"So now I'll move to If there aren't any questions with that data, I'll move to the geographic distribution. The guidelines lay out very specific geographic targets based upon where we see the highest concentrations of need for the states most vulnerable veterans. That's LA, the Bay Area, Orange County and San Diego. And so, of the 32 applications received, we saw a substantial number coming from the LA area. Really fewer than anticipated from the San Francisco Bay Area and San Diego. And so I think, kind of, the lesson Learned around that is we really would like to increase our outreach and future rounds to ensure that projects are ready and coming forward in all of those areas to ensure that we're targeting all of the places where we have concentrations of populations that need assistance.",0.0
False,,"In terms of kind of the funding mix, all projects except one rely on low income housing tax credits. It's obviously a very critical source of funding, especially where we're targeting for extremely low income populations. As I mentioned previously funding for services will continue, but will likely continue to be a challenge for the forseeable future. And the first round the services were being provided from a wide variety of sources including HUD's, Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program, or VASH Program, the supportive services for veteran's families funding, which is S-S-V-F program from the VA, as well as other VA programs, project operating income, the LA County Department of Health Services. And then many service providers are also providing in-kind services, as part of the project.",0.0

False,,"As I mentioned, we conducted extensive stakeholder outreach when we were developing the program guidelines, as well as extensive listening and feedback after the first NOFA and awards were made. I think what we concluded is we have a great mix of successes and lessons that we're building on in the second round, and in subsequent rounds.",0.0
False,,"Obviously a success is that we conceived and developed a program in less than a year, and got $63 million out the door, and are providing much needed housing for veterans. Nearly 12,000 units, 566 for veterans. So that is something, certainly, to be proud of.",0.0
False,,"We, in setting, in trying to meet the goals set out in statute in terms of meeting the needs of ELI households and veterans, as well as the permanent support of Housing, we well exceeded those goals, as I mentioned, and so that's a great success, and we're really proud of that accomplishment and happy we're able to exceed that.",0.0
False,,"And then I think based upon the feedback in the lessons learned sessions, we really are making relatively minor changes going into the second round in the hopes that folks are able to adapt projects that have been in the pipeline. And, as I mentioned, strengthen the relationships between the service providers and the housing development sponsors in order to bring forward more projects so that we make sure that we get the full 75 million out this round. In terms of lessons, certainly in any circumstance, new partnerships and collaboration are hard.",0.0
False,,"We come with our own lenses, marrying different cultures, and so this is really a process of expanding our knowledge base, learning about one another's cultures and building on that technical expertise and the perspectives that we both bring to the table. And so that is a lesson and I think part of it stepping back and just taking the time to listen to one another and to understand where each stakeholder is coming from.",0.0
False,,"We heard the need for an improved and clarified and streamlined application process and hopefully that is reflected in the new guidelines that came out this week. As I mentioned before, we did see that we need to have improved outreach in the Bay Area and San Diego in the next round, so we make sure we have better representation in those areas. And then as been mentioned several times, funding for services is going to continue to be a challenge and so we're just gonna have to get very creative there. Finally, as Ms. Gunn mentioned, we really need to continue to grow the competency in serving veterans and understanding the unique culture around the service provision and housing needs. So turning to the round two NOFA and guidelines, this week the second round of guidelines were released. We anticipate that the awards from this round will be made in June of next year.",0.0
False,,"Over the next month, we'll actually be hosting five guideline workshops, one of which will be a webinar. So this will be around the state, but then also one will be a webinar, so it's accessible to folks from around the state. We really have made very minor amendments to the first rung guidelines focusing primarily on clarifying and streamlining the application process as well as providing some best practices in the guidelines.",0.0
False,,"So where do we go from here? We anticipate that we'll continue to make $75 million available until the funding runs out. We anticipate that will be about seven or eight funding cycles. Our goal is to provide housing for 7,000 veterans and veteran family members. We hope to produce 4,900 units specifically for veterans experiencing homelessness, of which about 2,800 to 3,300 of those would be permanent, supportive housing for homeless veterans.",0.0
False,,"And obviously the outcome of all of this will hopefully be that in the State of California, we'll see significantly less veteran homelessness and in the coming decade. We'll continue to monitor the implementation of phase one and learn as those programs are put into service. We are in the midst of developing rigorous evaluation process evidenced by AB-388 to monitor the improvements of the veteran housing conditions, income, health, outcomes.",0.0
False,,"All of the significant factors that demonstrate the success of the program and in doing this we're involving UC Davis's Institute for population health improvement to assist with the evaluation protocols for the program. So I will conclude there, and thank you again for hosting and providing the leadership and hosting the hearing today. And I'll turn it over to Tia Patterson.",0.0
False,,"Yes, so 1,221 affordable housing units total, of which 566 units were being VHHP assisted. So in some cases we would have an affordable housing development that wouldn't be 100% for vets, or may have some mix of supportive housing. Different income levels. And so it could be a mix. But not necessarily 100% VHHP supported.",0.0
False,,"So generally in an affordable housing development there's a funding gap that exists, and it will be that funding gap is typically filled by a number of different funding sources. And so I mentioned that the vast majority of the projects had low income housing tax credits in there. And so low income tax credits aren't limited to veterans,",0.0
False,,"It can house a range of different populations and so there might be low income tax credits. It could be multi family housing program, as well as VHHP and so those funding sources were layered together in order to create, a larger number of affordable housing units, of which 566 were supported by and restricted to house veterans under this program. Does that help?",0.0
False,,"I'll just add onto Tia's comments. A lot of this really reflects the funding silos that we've really established, federal, state, local. Local, both at the county level, the city level, as well as among public policy areas. Often times, we'll line those up, but really is not, it's a conscious after the fact, but not necessarily up front trying to align our guidelines, align the programmatic pieces, along government and public policy silos. So it really is a reflection of that and so when enter into these collaborations, the reason it's messy is we're not accustomed to speaking each other's language, we don't use the same lens.",0.0
False,,"And so I think that's part of this process and the beauty of this program is that we really are pushing ourselves to align, to think a long the same lines, to try and speak the same language, to decode some of the things. I think anyone who is around affordable housing very long understands that we have lots of acronyms and we have our own language and I think that would go for, certainly the services area as well and so I think it really is a reflection of the way that we've funded your different aspects of public policy.",0.0
False,,"It is not necessarily typical, but from the perspective of where we were seeing similar demographics and concentrations, it made sense in the context of this particular program. But it is not necessarily what we do across programs.",0.0
False,,"So we're working really, really closely with our federal partners right now, and accessing as many resources as possible to align with the program. They understand the fact that we really stepped up as a state to try and address the problem of veteran homelessness. And so they're very willing participants and are engaging in really productive conversations about how we can bring more VASH vouchers to the state, SSVF funding, those types of resources in order to support the program, cuz they understand that the gap exists.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, well it's absolutely right. These are projects that we'll be breaking ground in the next few months to the next year maybe even longer. I think one of the things that I do want to emphasize in the second rounds is readiness, ensuring that the projects are as close as possible to breaking ground and being put into services possible. But in terms of tracking the success, I mean obviously we won't know the success until they've been placed into service and we can begin to collect the data that we spoke about today. Yeah, we do.",0.0
False,,I don't think we have a specific time on any of them yet.,0.0
False,,"There were really a variety of reasons. I mentioned, really because of the time in which applications had to prepare and submit applications and the novelty of the program the partnerships weren't necessarily in place. The projects weren't necessarily designed for these populations and didn't really meet the criteria that we had put out in the guidelines.",0.0
False,,"And obviously the development sponsors are planning for their projects 18 months, 24 months, 36 months even in advance. And so when a funding source comes in kind of late in the pipe line, it's really difficult to kind of back track and change the design, change the features, change the types of units, the unit mix, those types of things.",0.0
False,,"And then really as I spoke to earlier I mean the silos that we've kind of lived in between service providers and housing development sponsors, has really, with MHSA, with MHP, supportive housing, those types of things, has been growing. But really this particular program brings it to a whole new level.",0.0
False,,"And so really giving developers and service providers the time to strengthen those partnerships to align the service provision and the development, takes a little bit more time. So I think that's probably a primary factor is really just the time frames.",0.0
False,,"But beyond the applications that actually went through scoring and were competitive but did lose points on a variety of categories. Not really any particular cause we could point to but as I mentioned earlier, the places where folks tended to lose a significant amount of points that seem to contribute to being less competitive was the quality of the supportive services plan. And one of the kind of lessons Learned for us was really clarifying exactly what we were looking for there. So were providing some more clarity in the second round and make sure that folks know exactly what it is that we're looking for.",0.0
False,,"Project readiness, and this was something because we did want to kind of create some time frames so that we can bring units on-line quickly. And so folks may not have been far enough along. May not have secured all the resources necessary to break ground and to move forward with constructing the project and then the experience of the lead service provider. So those were the areas that we saw.",0.0
False,,"Very similar set of circumstances really. Readiness, the level of relationships, how far along the projects were in terms of moving down the pipeline in terms of their design and the features of the development.",0.0
False,,And really just not being ready with the level of service plan that we're looking for in order to meet the needs of the populations that we're trying to house.,0.0
False,,566 units.,0.0
False,,And their family members.,0.0
False,,"If I can just add, I think we can't get there if we don't know where we're going. We can't do that without data, and so that's part of this, is how do we really set the policies and show that we're moving the needle broadly on housing our veterans and ensuring that we're getting them off the streets, if we're not tracking that data? And so I think that's one piece and the best place to do that is to really kind of reach down into the continuum of cares and make sure that they're consistently tracking data and that we are able to kind of tap into that and to help integrate that.",0.0
False,,"But I think the other piece, too, one of the reasons that HUD really pushed in this direction was that they were finding that individuals, many of which are likely chronically homeless veterans, were cycling through the system.",0.0
False,,"So we're talking, to some extent, about big picture today, looking at aggregate data. But the reality is what folks were seeing, that were down in the trenches trying to ensure that folks were really getting assisted and stabilized and getting off the streets, was that a single individual would cycle through social service providers, shelters, transitional housing, multiple, multiple times and no one was tracking that.",0.0
False,,"And so one social service provider would see them over here and then the next week they would be over here. So we have no idea whether or not that person is being appropriately housed and stabilized and so that's another function. Its really the human face of what all of this data means is that in order to track it in the aggregate that we're ensuring that that one individual that is jumping from social service provider to different housing, transitional housing shelters.",0.0
False,,That that individual is getting off the streets and stabilized and their underlying conditions are being addressed.,0.0
False,,"As close as possible. I mean, obviously what we wanna do is deploy this money as quickly as possible, as effectively as possible, bring quality projects online so that we can get folks off the streets as quickly as possible and appropriately house veterans as quickly as possible. So ideally readiness really needs to be a factor so that way our money isn't just sitting there, but it's being invested to very quickly ensure that we're making an impact.",0.0

False,,"As this transportation funding package comes together, we wish to remind you to also consider the needs of public transit, which, of course, serves to increase mobility options and improve environmental objectives that the state is striving to achieve. To that end, we think that the governor's proposal to advance $400 million annually for public transit makes good sense.",0.0
False,,"We think that if that proposal is ultimately included within the transportation funding package, it should be allocated to the existing programs that were established just last year. Those being the ELSITO program and the TIRCP. Thank you so much. Goodbye.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanna first start by commending you for putting this together. During the year we saw a plethora of different legislative actions to address this issue.",0.0
False,,"Because of your leadership, you saw early on that it was kind of nibbling at the sides, and it didn't really address the full problem. The purpose of these hearings, as the Chairman Quirk has mentioned, is to have a comprehensive plan on how we deal with this.",0.0
False,,"Not only just legislatively, but also through the budget process. How do we get the resources down to the communities so that we can eliminate and ultimately abolish this heinous action that's going on in our state? And so, I'm extremely excited because I think this will be the first,",0.0
False,,"at least from the State of California, this will be the first effort to look at a long range in a comprehensive way that we can deal with this. Human trafficking hit us like nothing else before. I think the last time we've had this kind of emergency was when we had the crack cocaine epidemic.",0.0
False,,"It just was like a tsunami that overtook us. Law enforcement has said that they need more resources, and sometimes they don't even know what they need. And so I'm welcoming not only ideas that we're doing in the state, but out of state. Because, this is not only a local issue, a state issue, it's become a national,",0.0
False,,"and I can say international problem, that the resources that we're using now may not be enough. And we need to apply more resources. So again, I wanna thank the Chairman for bringing us all together because I know he made a commitment that we would do this.",0.0
False,,"And I know it was under very harsh and trying times because there were laws that were brought before this Committee. Mr. Sumner, Ms. Krell, where you're sitting now, we had legislators that pleaded with us to move ahead with legislation that we knew would not fully address the problem. And he had the courage to say let's look at this comprehensively and that's difficult,",0.0
False,,and so I'm glad we're here and that we're now going to address it.,0.0
False,,"And hopefully this is a quick question or a question that you can follow up later. I'm a recovering bureaucrat. I worked in the city for 25 years. And I know that the AG's office has task forces to deal with drugs,",0.0
False,,"drug kingpins, and things of that nature. Because I'm a firm believer that there's gotta be somebody in charge. And I think through your task force that you put together for those type of incidents, is because you need someone in charge to coordinate the county effort,",0.0
False,,"the city effort, human resources, everything, to pull together. Have you, at that part of your job of what you would like to do, would you like to create in the AG's office so that we can systematically pool all our resources to tackle it, or is that something that's really huge?",0.0
False,,"Just remember, if you need money, I do, I am a chair budget sub five so don't worry about the money, just worry about solving the problem. And as you can see from the passion of every one on this Committee, Assemblymember Santiago, this is really important.",0.0
False,,"And if it's something you can't answer now or to be able to get back to me, I would love to see a budget package, or something. So that, the reason for this is so that we can actually tackle the problem this year. That was the promise we made to several members of this Committee.",0.0
False,,"And again, I'll make it brief cause the hour is late. For me, what I would like to do is really focus in on the victims and I say that because as I'm learning more and more about it, you have a young person at 11 or 10 years old that basically gets brainwashed into this.",0.0
False,,"And even though it looks like when they hit 21 they may be willing participants, but they really are traumatized. They have the worst form of PTSD and to send them to jail for something that they believe in their mind, is the only way to make a living, the only way they can live, because they've been brainwashed basically.",0.0
False,,"We need to have an alternative. And I don't think we really have that en masse. So that we're really talking about a mental health problem that we need to deal with, and I don't know if we have enough practitioners out there that's doing that.",0.0
False,,"I don't know if there's enough resources. I don't know if we can have law enforcement just say, we can have enough wrap-around services that we can grab that person, bring them in, and then ultimately, help them in a substantive way.",0.0
False,,"And so that's why I've been looking forward to doing this, and as the chair of Budget Sub5, more important, finding, as Mr. Quirk says, maybe a large portion of money or resources might be diverted to the human aspect of it, and taking care of it.",0.0
False,,"I have a way of looking at legislation that is probably very similar to what you do. And I tell people all the time, and as we move forward with this, Stephanie Richards, I have the four cs, communicate, cover, consequences, and costs. And so as a recovering bureaucrat I tell people, go talk to the people who have to implement it, because a lot of times we in the Legislature, we create things and it is not enough money or it's just a stupid idea or it just doesn't make any sense.",0.0
True,toxicity,"And then we'll yell at the people who have to implement it because they're saying, then you're the dumb ones, and we're saying no, you're the dumb ones. At the end of the day, the people who are trying to help suffer try to cover everything possible so that we, as inclusive, so we don't have to come back and do makeup legislation.",0.7442514896392822
False,,"And then consequences, the unintended consequences of some of the things that we do are more harmful sometimes than the actual legislation. And then finally, for me, which we always seem to forget, is cost. And especially at a time where we're fortunate to have some money and in the general fund, we should figure out what it will cost to actually implement it and make that part of the legislation, make that part of the budget requests.",0.0
False,,"And so that when we're going in, we're not underfunding things or not funding it at all and then have it not happen. So I have the same four Cs in that order, so I wanna thank you.",0.0
False,,I wanna thank all of you and everyone that's testified because it has been illuminating. And I think we will have a very robust discussion come the fall. But I also think we're gonna have a robust package of both legislation and funding opportunities coming in the fall.,0.0

False,,"Sojourner Truth. Sojourner Truth, a former slave was famous as an abolitionist and advocate for a woman's right to vote. Her famous speech, ""Ain't I a Woman,"" was extemporaneously delivered at the woman's convention of 1851.",0.0
False,,"There's a famous part of that that I always remember and this is probably more for the men in this room that whenever I get too much of myself as a man that I remember this quote. May I read, Madame Speaker?",0.0
False,,"Evidently, there was a man in the room who had made some disparaging remarks about women and men being superior and she said, ""Then that little man in black there, he says women can't have as much rights as men because Christ wasn't a woman."" She said, ""Where did Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From god and a woman. Man had nothing to do with him.""",0.0

False,,"Mr. Chairman, members, good seeing you. Let me first thank the Attorney General's Office for a very thorough and concise distillation of the very complex matter that's before us.

False,,"To put this into context I would like to provide a brief overview of DCA. For those that don't have the pleasure of really getting in deep with the Department of Consumer Affairs, it's very deep and it's very vast, and it is unlike other departments that are within this administration.",0.0

These programs regulate more than 250 different business, professional and occupational categories including doctors, dentists, contractors, cosmetologists, and automotive repair dealers. I got it out.",0.0
False,,"Boards exist as semi-autonomous entities within the department whose members are appointed by the Governor and the Legislature with the authority to set their own policies and priorities. For example, the boards may pursue their own statutory changes through the Legislature without approval from the department.",0.0
False,,"The department's oversight of the boards is generally limited to administrative regulatory functions. However the department provides public comment at board meetings, provides legal counsel, facilitates personnel and other administrative transactions, and investigates board activities.",0.0
False,,"The department also has specific authority to review and approve regulatory changes and provide many other administrative services including mandatory training to new board members and compliance with conflict of interest reporting requirements. As the director, I have a limited authority to approve some board executive officer hires.

False,,"Bureaus, unlike boards, serve under the direct jurisdiction of the department, and the bureau chiefs are appointed by either the Governor or myself. The Director of the department must require a confirmation by the Senate.",0.0
False,,"Bureaus must seek approval from the department prior to making any policy related actions. I say this to draw a distinction between the different structures within the department. While the department may be comprised of many separate and unique licensing programs, we have created economies of scale that reduce costs and improve efficiency. To further discuss impacts of the North Carolina case on the boards of the department, I'd like to turn over to Ms. Tamara Colson, my assistant general counsel.",0.0
False,,"I will take the first attempt at this. And then, I will probably defer to a much more able legal mind than myself. So, the role of the staff counsels that serve the 40 boards, bureaus, commissions, programs are essentially staff counsels.",0.0

I would submit to this body that I am comfortable right now with my current authority, you know, which is why I do not disagree with Mr. Sumner in it is serious, in that we should look at this, which is Mr. Hill, I'm glad you called this hearing, but it's not critical because of my current authority. In that, I'll defer to Ms. Colson in how those attorneys would advise that client.",0.0
False,,"Can I just? On a board issue though, so if, I'll set up a scenario. If you were advising one of my boards, correct that privilege is with the board not the director.",0.0
False,,"I do, on numerous issues, I do have at least one counsel advising me, serves that similar role but to my executive office and executive team. So it's an interesting structure, but it does serve the boards and bureau as well.",0.0

False,,"I definitely locked on to a statement that you said which I could not agree more of fact based and evidence based, which is why the department, with the help of the Attorney General's Office and the Governor's Office, came out as early as possible to train. We truly believe that the best way to mitigate this, not the only, the best way to mitigate this is a well trained, well informed board.",0.0
False,,"Board members individually, board as a whole. And to document and memorialize the decisions they make and why they make it. As things come up, and they will, the best way to mitigate that is to have public records,",0.0
False,,"to go on record saying, this is why we made this decision, have proper minutes. All of which my colleague, to my right, mentioned. We've taken those steps. Everything after that is ripe for discussion, but",0.0
False,,"a well informed, well educated board that serves exactly what you said, the consumers, is the best, in my opinion, the best defense.",0.0
False,,"Well it's, the decision in that case, a board that regulates doctors would make the decision, if you do not meet these qualifications then you know you are not a Doctor. The thought process to get there is in the best interest of the consumers, and it is documented, and it is clear that that body is not",0.0
False,,"acting in the interest of any one person, or in Association, etc. They are doing this setting minimum competency or minimal qualifications because it is in the best interest of the consumers. So that is exactly, again, going back to training, going back to memorializing, why boards opine and make these decisions is extraordinarily important.",0.0
False,,"So one of the biggest steps that we've taken shortly after the North Carolina ruling was the training. And I'll defer to my colleague to get into the details of what type of record keeping, etc.",0.0
False,,"But the training that we had, it was on the 21st, correct? Also folding some of that training into the board member orientation, we call it BMOT. Refreshers are always a good thing.",0.0
False,,"There are things that are lost after you're reappointed. We wanna make sure, given how important this is, we felt it important to put into the board member orientation training, to make sure that it's always on the forefront of people's mind as they make a decision. Whether they feel it is important or not, it is important to go on record and be in the most defensible position possible. I'll yield my time to Miss Colson.",0.0

False,,"I'm not shy about picking up the phone, and expressing how I feel about things.",0.0
False,,"I think I will, given the importance of it and how it affected entities nationwide, it will definitely be a much more critical filter. I think my current authority definitely covers that and",0.0
False,,"the way I view it is injurious to my current authority which is, I'm able to reject based on regulations being injurious to the public. We've had a loose interpretation of that even before the North Carolina.",0.0

I thank everyone that stood today on behalf of HR 10 to speak passionately about how this event means a lot to you.",0.0
False,,"When we went to Selma, Kevin McCarty and Sebastian Ridley-Thomas and myself, we were very humbled by standing there where Martin Luther King stood, Hosea Williams.",0.0
False,,"But not only was it humbling, it was also sobering because as we sat there knowing that 50 years ago there was a young man named Jimmy Lee Jackson who was shot by a public safety officer state trooper, unarmed African-American male and then to come back to your hotel room, turn on your TV and know that almost to the day, a young African-American male in Wisconsin was shot by a public safety officer.",0.0
False,,"It tells you that no matter how much things have changed, some things are still the same. And so, when we look at taking that march from Selma to Montgomery, to know that on the steps of the Montgomery statehouse 50 years ago, there was a Governor named George Wallace that said segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever, during that time.",0.0

False,,"That's important. This has to be done out in the open and in public where folks can see. The establishment of charter schools was not us, the public, yielding control to the agencies that serve us. Having secret and private meetings about how tax dollars are being spent in this state is not innovation, it does not benefit the system.",0.0
False,,"And in fact, it has resulted in a number of horror stories which I would be happy to share with you if you want to hear more about some of the specifics. But, what this bill is saying to charter schools is do what you want, but do it out in the open where everyone can see.",0.0
False,,"What this bill is truly saying is dream big and think outside the box. But don't abuse the public trust and spend that money on our children, spend that money on our students.

False,,Charter school board members actually step up to make sure that their doors stay open. The Legislature and the governor deferd payment to schools including Charter Schools for several years during the recession. School districts had many options to bridge that gap until the recession was over and the money was restored.,0.0
False,,"Charter schools did not have those same options. We had board members who were stepping up and making loans to charter schools just to keep the door open. Low interest, no interest, it doesn't matter if there's a financial arrangement between the board member and the charter school. Under 1090 it would be prohibited and the person would be criminally liable.",0.0

If you have a board member of a charter school who has a facility that he thinks, and the school thinks, would be ideal for the school.

False,,"We agree that there needs to be financial integrity. There are ways of ensuring that without imposing such an absolute prohibition as 1090 entails. We have oversight by school districts, we have other laws. Don't dismiss the corporation's code as being too light on board members.",0.0

The responsibility of the school district is to oversee all of the charter school, including it's financial activities.",0.0
False,,"And that includes these kinds of loans and the activities of the charter school in terms of what they do on a day to day basis, and on an extraordinary basis, as had to happen during the period of referrals. So, that's all ready occurring.",0.0
False,,"We also think in the other pieces of this bill is going to add additional scrutiny and transparency that we find very helpful. So the Brown Act makes sure that, even though a lot of charter schools are already doing the Brown Act, it would make sure that all charter schools are doing all of these activities totally in public at a public hearing that's noticed and agendized and the issues are on that agenda.",0.0
False,,"In addition, Political Reform Act requires, as I said earlier, form 700 to be filled out by all of its board members. So all of the financial information about those board members, just like you Dr. Pan and Senator Vidak is gonna be very transparent, very public.",0.0
False,,"So I think there's a lot of good things in terms of transparency in this bill, but we also believe that 47605 is, it's pretty clear about ensuring that transparency, as well.",0.0
False,,"Doctor, If you don't mind mine answering one more way and that is that 1090 is not a transparency provision of law because it is scorched earth as you've already heard. There's no transparency. The transparency comes in the other parts of the bill. That's important to make that distinction.",0.0

And the most important distinction it makes is, it says that if you're a for-profit and you have one of three things, you govern the budget of the charter school, you employ its teachers and other employees, or you have governance control of the charter school, then you cannot operate in the state of California.",0.0
False,,"Those are three key elements of what governance and control of a charter school is. So if you do any one of those, you would not be able to operate. With that language, we would support the bill. We think it is a policy that deserves to be part of the California Charter Schools Act.",0.0
False,,"Unfortunately, those amendments have not been accepted, and the bill in print is what's before you. We think it opens up a lot questions about what it actually means.

False,,"It's unfortunate that we still remain opposed to the bill. And it's for two very practical reasons. First, I do want to point out that Senator Hill has actually done a bang-up job in his district, in making it clear to his school board, San Mateo Unified, and the people in his community, that he doesn't think that they handled this situation in the best manner possible.",0.0
False,,"And we've always thought, since this issue was first brought to us last fall, that this is an issue best handled at the local level.

False,,"Los Angeles Unified, because they have so many Prop 39 requests, has made a point to shift the responsibility to the superintendent. So the superintendent makes the offer, the board does not take action on that offer. And there's no requirement that they do.",0.0
False,,"And in Los Angeles, that's important, because they get 80 to 100 Prop 39 requests every year.

Those school board meetings would become Prop 39 meetings. There would be no time to do anything else.",0.0
False,,"The other issue that we have from our standpoint is: the law is very prescriptive, both in terms of the statute, the regulations, as well as case law that's devleoped over the last fourteen years. That prescriptive law limits the amount of discretion that a school district has relative to meeting the definition of ""reasonably equivalent.""",0.0
False,,"Having public hearings and public comment and all that leads the public to assume that there is something else that can be done.

False,,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to clarify two things real quick. One, this is very much an administrative process because it is, so much expertise is necessary to do this that you can't really leave it up to sort of a policy 30,000 foot-level debate.",0.0
False,,"And I do want to correct one thing the Senator said relative to discretion, it is actually the issue of discretion about the location that is, it's hard to have any discretion. When you're talking about number of classrooms, you're talking about square footage, you're talking about all the amenities of the facility in order to accommodate the students. There are very few places in most school districts that would meet the very specific requirements of the offer that has to be made under Proposition 39.",0.0
False,,"Yeah if I may, Madame Chair, Senator Pan, and I appreciate the question.",0.0
False,,"Absolutely, through the chair. What Senator Hill is describing is a discrete situation in his district. And yes there may have been options, but my understanding, and Ms. Kollman may be able to expand on this further 'cause she actually represented the charter school in that situation, Design Tech, is that the location of the school was something that needed to happen quickly, right away, so they could open the school and get things going.",0.0
False,,"The other options were not options that were available. The co-location at Mills High School was always intended to be temporary. And as we understand it, in the next school year, they are expected to be someplace else.",0.0
False,,"And everybody knew that going into it, that this was gonna be the case. But the options that Senator Hill is talking about were not available to the school district at the time that the school needed to be open. They couldn't wait another year or two for other location possibilities.",0.0
False,,"I mean, it does underscore the fact that every school district is different, every school district is gonna have a different set of circumstances, and unfortunately most of them are not gonna have options even a couple years down the road, because the facilities in the school district are very limited, especially in terms of meeting those very specific requirements for square footage and classroom and all that kinda stuff.",0.0

False,,"And so while you move through this on a policy level, hopefully you're looking in the corner of your eye to make sure we also can have the money there to afford it, because the last thing you want to happen is, as we all know, we go through this whole process, and we get to the financial part, and then it dies.

False,,"You'll see that as Ms. Grove pointed out, one rate increased 2006-07 was the only rate increase that the legislature and governor have given in the last 12 state budgets to this community. Meanwhile, the cost of living went up 30% during that time period.",0.0
False,,"So where does the money come from?

We certainly appreciate and share the author's concern about opioid drug abuse which of course results in far too many overdoses and deaths. This is why health plans in part utilize medical management controls that prevent the expenditure of premium dollars on abusive behavior. So it is a serious problem for America, but however, we do not believe that this bill will significantly curb the abuse of these drugs as eloquently laid out by Mr. Caldwell.",0.0
False,,"Our association typically opposes new health benefit mandates because they drive up health care costs for enrollees in the individual and employer markets. New mandates may conflict with the federal Affordable Care Act rules regarding essential health benefits. According to those rules, states have to pay 100% of the health exchange subsidies to consumers for the cost associated with new mandates that extend beyond the essential health benefits. Mandates reduce the flexibility in benefit design for large employers. They also increase premiums.",0.0
False,,"On this last point we do believe that this bill will increase costs for the purchasers of health care. The, this committee as well as Health Committee could have benefited from the independent analysis by on the premium impacts of this bill. As is the usual process for mandate bills. As, as noted by Mr. Caldwell, this bill has been introduced in a number of other states and in those states, the fiscal notes indicate premium increases as a result of that legislation.",0.0

False,,"So, for these reasons, and I will actually mention that we have also asked to see some of the evidence that was mentioned in opposition, or in support of this bill against one of our hospital systems. And we have asked for that information, have not received it. If violations to the level that they are mentioning did occur, CDPH has the complete authority to go in and levy penalties.

False,,"And so while you move through this on a policy level, hopefully you're looking in the corner of your eye to make sure we also can have the money there to afford it, because the last thing you want to happen is, as we all know, we go through this whole process, and we get to the financial part, and then it dies.

However, the amendments that were taken on May 28th, to insert the corporate practice of medicine and imply those provisions.",0.0
False,,"That ban to other healthcare professionals is very problematic for hospital members. That ban creates an additional layer of obstacles that we see for providing healthcare services to those communities, rural, low-income, communities of color. Where getting healthcare professionals are problematic. Where having physicians in those communities is already a challenge. So to place an additional layer of burden, and not allow for hospitals to employ these professionals, really creates a problem. This bill does expand and removes the physician oversight requirement. And thus creates the opportunity for these practitioners to work in our facilities, but with the corporate practice language in the bill that does create a very big problem. And for us we are not able to support this bill today. And I have additional. Person here to answer any technical questions you may have.",0.0

False,,"Madam Chair and senators, Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association, proud to cosponsor this important legislation. I'm just going to talk about two pieces of the bill, one about the capacity of an authorizer to do effective oversight and another about the impact on neighborhood schools.",0.0
False,,"We have been having conversations with the administrators, with school boards, with the Charter Schools Association, with Classified School Staff to bring forward the best policy. And I know that this committee last week considered bill by Senator Pavley which was about a very small authorizer that placed the charter school outside of its school district and what I want to clarify is that that was an isolated incident.",0.0
False,,That there are several tiny districts throughout the state where they're authorizing charter schools when they don't have either the capacity to do that kind of oversight and so I know that my colleague from California Virtual Academy is going to talk about some of their structure and some similar things that we've seen in different areas with authorizers across the state.,0.0
False,,"But the questions we were proposing as stake holders is number one like what are-- let's better define what exactly are your responsibilities and obligations with respect to oversight and number two, what do you need to have in place to carry out those duties.",0.0
False,,"And so what this bill suggests is that when you're considering what kind of support you have from parents, from teachers to establish a new charter school based on the petition that you also consider a report about your capacity which hopefully will be useful in determining what staff you have in place to do that important oversight work.",0.0
False,,"Do you need to build new structures? Do you need to have new staff etcetera. We were pleased to see that in the opposition letter from the Charter Schools Association, that appear they agreed on that point. That it would be useful for a school district to assess how it will conduct oversight.",0.0
False,,"Additionally, this bill suggests that when a new charter petition comes forward, we also consider what the impact is going to be on other school districts-- sorry, other schools where the district has oversight capacity. In most cases charter schools are authorized by a school district although we recognize some could be authorized by county office, some by state board.",0.0
False,,"The idea is that the authorizer takes a look at their charter schools, takes a look at their traditional public efforts to provide better coordination. And develops a plan for all the schools that they're responsible for oversight looking at things like the geographic distribution of schools,",0.0
False,,"projected demographic changes and that new charter petitions that come forward are evaluated in respect to how they impact that plan. What we have seen from voters is-- before any charter schools approved, voters would love us to conduct an analysis of the impact that the school will have on neighborhood public schools. The public doesn't want their great neighborhood public school harmed by decisions that are made by their elected officials.",0.0
False,,"In the polling data we see basically it's that school down the street two blocks down where I send my kids has a great for foreign arts program, has a wonderful library, has a science lab, whatever you're doing as a district don't impact this great neighborhood school. So what is this bill about? This bill is about what all Californians want which is a great school in every neighborhood. We urge your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Madam Chair and members, Nancy Chaires Espinoza with the California School Boards Association. As you know current law does not allow a local education agency to deny a charter petition even if the school board or county office knows that doing so would result in negative certification or if they know, they simply don't have that capacity to provide the necessary oversight.",0.0
False,,This bill would provide that ability which we think is very important and in some areas where there are-- where there's declining enrollment or w have small rural school districts for example this is a particularly important issue so we respectfully ask for your support for this measure. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Thank you, Madam Chair and members. Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association. We really appreciate the work of the committee and certainly the author in agreeing to take out the negative fiscal impact portion of the bill that was the biggest part of the bill that we objected to but we are still very concerned about the bidding practices piece.",0.0
False,,"I do want to point out that as Mr. Bramble indicated, we did think-- do think the idea of the school district doing some analysis on their capacity to do oversight is really helpful and we think that they should be doing that not as a reason to reject the charter but so they can prepare themselves to do the right thing when the charter is authorized.",0.0
False,,"And hey, they make sure that they put the right resources into it. I do want to comment on one of the comments that the-- one of the CAVA representatives made about the oversight of this-- of the charter schools from tiny school districts. For those who may not be aware charter schools have to pay anywhere from 1 to 3% of their revenue to the oversight district.",0.0
False,,So a very tiny school district that's authorizing a school that has 3000 students in San Diego is bringing in $300 000 from the charter school. I think that's enough money to pay for sufficient resources to be doing aggressive oversight. I think Madam Chair in your comments on SB 322 earlier today really hit the nail on the head relative to that bill and this bill.,0.0
False,,"The problem is really about oversight and as you've instructed us and I'm taking it back to CCSA, let's see if we can come up with some ideas to strengthen oversight but clearly, resources is not a problem.

False,,"Again, it doesn't make sense to us. There's a lot of onerous and burdensome stuff in the bidding practices law. I used to represent school districts and school districts also hate this law.",0.0
False,,"I would like to see it eased in many ways so why we extend that to charter schools that are in less of a position to be able to do that doesn't not make sense to us. If there is a specific problem, let's deal with that specific problem but let's please not make a blanket change to the statute simply because somebody is having a dispute within one charter school.

False,,"These, aforementioned earlier by Donna Burns, these are planes that go into the education of both non-credit and credit in terms of integrated learning. The other is the concern of the lack of a data interface, a state-wide one.

AB 1083 is a very small district bill which will amend the political reform act 1974 in order to authorize the Fair Political Practices Commission to enter into a mutual agreement with the City of Stockton to enforce locally adopted campaign finance or ordinances. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.,0.0
False,,"Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague from San Bernardino for speaking on all my bills today so elegantly and, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Speaker, members. AB 61 is a consumer protection bill that provide more transparency a residential care facilities for the elderly known as RCFEs. As you are may have heard we do have a silver tsunami coming and this bill will help to protect our seniors in their final years of residence.",0.0
False,,"As you probably remember last year the owner of Valley Springs Manor in  Castor valley abandoned 19 RCFE residents leaving the cook and the janitor to care for them. It later turned out that she had a history of hundreds of thousands of dollars and fines owed to the federal and state licensing agencies for different nursing homes she owned in California. This bill will prevent individuals and corporations with the history of non-compliance with opening new facilities in the state by asking the department social services to cross-reference these and by establishing further to their website where people can be able to go on the Department of Social Services website and see what people have owned, what allegations they've had against them, what things have they been out of compliance, and make good decisions about where their loved ones go in their final years of life. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"I think my colleagues all who spoke on this important issue and, I certainly respect the minority parties position that regulation is not a good thing, but certainly is our duty and obligation to be able to protect our seniors as well as our children and, we have plenty of evidence of abuse because regulation has not been in place and, this simply brings things online so we continue to work with the department and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and Members, Mel Assagai for Crystal Casino. We don't have a position on the bill. We do think there should be more consideration of whether or not we're going to find that it's an illegal or legal form of gambling. We appreciate the Chairman's attempt to put it into to a regulatory framework to protect consumers.",0.0
False,,"We think that's terrific. We just want to make sure that as we go forward, we look to see that this is a legal form of gambling and not something we'll regret having acted on this early. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,Would like to move to bill.,0.0
False,,"Chairman Bell and Chairman Nielson and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to address you today. This is an important program. HCD is proud to be in partnership with CalVet and CalHFA in implementing a program that allows us to support finding stable and affordable housing to California's veterans.",0.0
False,,"My testimony today will first focus on a broad set of principals that have guided the three implementing departments in the design of the program. I'll then share highlights Learned from round one from the program and then I'll close with some statistics from the applications received from round two. In order to minimise the length and complexity of the presentation, we've provided a number of handouts Tricia has already alluded to you. That should be in front of you by now and throughout the presentation I'll refer by number to those hand outs.",0.0
False,,"So let me start with principle number one. By design the VHHP program seeks to flexibly address a wide range of housing and service needs for our state's diverse veteran population. The program recognizes California's veteran population as neither a single monolithic group nor homogenous group. As such, the program allows project sponsors to design projects that address a variety of demographic and social needs within the larger veteran population.",0.0
False,,"So let me give you just a couple examples of these diverse needs. Veterans age 55 and older are making up a larger cohort of the veteran population and increasingly these veterans will need housing and supportive housing services to help them stay in their homes and communities as both by virtue of the fact that they're aging, as well as their special needs as being veterans. Homeless veterans tend to be older than the non-veteran homeless, making the need to assist aging veterans a growing imperative.",0.0
False,,"A second demographic is the needs of the post-9/11 veterans. These are unique, as they face employment and economic challenges as they transition to civilian life. The median age of the post 9/11 veterans is 29 years old, and the group is far more diverse, both in gender and ethnicity, than veterans coming from prior conflicts.",0.0
False,,Many of those that have recently transitioned to civilian life encountered extraordinary challenges in translating their military experience into stable employment opportunities at a time when the economy was weak and unemployment was high. These difficulties have often been compounded by the fact that housing affordability challenges are the greatest in the places where job opportunities exist.,0.0
False,,"A third demographic group that we're particularly focused on at this time is a rapidly growing demographic with families with children and specifically female veterans with children. Female veterans are a growing share of the veteran population. They currently make up about 9% of the veteran population in California, and that percentage is expected to rise dramatically in future years. Female veterans have increased risk for homelessness when compared to non-veteran females. 50% of single veteran mothers are housing cost burdened compared to 25% of all veterans.",0.0
False,,"In addition, service related post traumatic stress disorders, military sexual trauma are also risk factors in housing instability. Turning to principal number two this is that communities also need to address their needs based upon their diverse needs. So for example local demographics, access to resource, cost of housing, cost of development, are all factors that have to be taken into consideration as local communities seek to address their veteran housing and services needs.",0.0
False,,"Recognizing that one size does not fit all, the VHHP seeks to provide communities flexibility in serving their local needs while ensuring that Statewide legislative objectives are being met. A few ways in which this is accomplished is through flexibility in the project type. VHHP provides flexibility in how development and services are funded. VHHP prioritizes supportive housing as required by Proposition 41, but also allows funding of other critical housing types including family housing and transitional housing.",0.0
False,,"In addition, we provide flexibility through the population served. VHHP prioritizes support of housing for the most vulnerable Veteran populations. But there's also flexibility to mix populations within a particular project, both Vet and non-Vet populations, or to serve other special needs sub-populations, as well as the general veteran population with in a project. However I want to emphasize that VHHP funding is only invested in those units that are actually housing veteran population in compliance with the statute.",0.0
False,,"The third principal is that supportive housing provided through VHHP serves and seeks to stabilize the most vulnerable veterans experiencing homelessness. VHHP financial systems are structured specifically to provide deeper financial systems when this population is being served. And given the lack of upgrading income from the residents, additional operating services funding outside the project cash flow is also necessary for ongoing financial viability and services. This is a theme, obviously you'll hear quite a bit today.",0.0
False,,"To insure delivery of quality services and more successful outcomes for residents, VHHP projects require lead service providers who are experienced in providing veterans-centric and housing-first oriented services. And in addition, VHHP requires intensive, on-site case managers to provide services tailored to each veteran's needs, with an emphasis on service, revision that is flexible, voluntary, and easily accessible.",0.0
False,,"Principle number four is that VHHP investments should be made in a way that maximize the ability to leverage and integrate with other community investments to address veteran homelessness and housing instability. For example, we incentivize commitments from the HUD-VASH program, the Housing Choice voucher and other creative ways to provide operational stability such as local subsidies.",0.0
False,,"To ensure the most pressing community needs are being served and that projects are integrated into the overall community strategies, we reward projects that collaborate with the local continuum of care, the VA offices on the local level, as well as other local level efforts.",0.0
False,,"A fifth principle is that VHHP investments should reflect where veterans with the highest needs actually live. Through the program guidelines, we've established geographic targets based upon where we see concentrations of homeless veterans and extremely low income renters that have severe cost burdens. We're going to continue to re evaluate these geographic targets as new data comes available, to ensure that our investments are actually accurately reflect the most dire needs.",0.0
False,,"And then finally, and this will be part of Tia's testimony as well, I'll just briefly touch on a significant principal is that we are all as the implementing departments Significantly committed to ongoing and deep stakeholder engagement and feedback, evaluation of the program and individual outcomes in making continuous improvements through the program.",0.0
False,,"All right, so I'll now turn to round one outcomes and the lessons Learned there. I'm gonna refer you to handout number four, that provides some more in-depth information, but I'm just gonna highlight a couple of the key issues today. It is called handout number four, February 2015, funding round one outcomes. Got it? Okay, great.",0.0
False,,"Okay, so while the program establishes a high set of standards for the type of housing and services required. Applicants are successfully meeting the requirements, this is one of the lessons we're learning. 13 of the 17 funded projects in round one incorporate supportive housing and 66% of the housing units funded by VHHP are supportive housing. Projects were structured during round one to, or those awarded during round one, were structured to allow a diversity of populations to be served, including veteran families and seniors.",0.0
False,,"Nine projects will contain two bedroom units, representing 24% of the VHHP funded units, having two or more bedrooms so that accommodates the veterans with families. In addition three projects will serve senior veterans. Given feedback from round one we also know that there's an interest in serving female veterans, especially those with histories of military sexual trauma or domestic violence. The design of the project would likely require special safety and security considerations as well as specialized services.",0.0
False,,"We also know that there may be some fair housing issues here that could present challenges to offer single gender housing. However, with CalVet's leadership on this topic we're exploring ways in which VHHP can serve this important population. A second lesson is that both communities and applicants are really pulling together to ensure the highest quality of housing and services related to the VHHP funded projects.",0.0
False,,"I'm gonna now refer you to handout number three and this one is entitled Typical Service Models in Support of Housing. And so we'll focus first on page one. We know that with the years of experience in administering MHP supportive housing program, as well are experience in the first VHHP round, that there's no one services model or single way to fund services But in general, services and support of housing comprised of mixed of federal state and local resources.",0.0
False,,"In the case of round one, of the 13 supportive housing projects, 8 have external rental subsidies including 4 from HUD-VASH, which also includes funding for case management. On site individual case management is typically paid for through cash flow, grant sources, or VASH. Some projects are also using Continuum of Care or Supportive Services for Veteran Families, a program which is also known as SSVF or Case Management Services.",0.0
False,,"Another creative way that project sponsors are using is to provide additional financial support for the projects is to actually mix incomes in the project. This structure allows additional cashflow that can be used to fund services for those sort of housing units. To meet the diverse needs of residents, case management must connect to the widest array of mainstream community-based services as possible, such as healthcare, mental health, employment, education, substance abuse services, and income supports.",0.0
False,,"Sometimes these services are co-located and visible within the particular development, but also, they may be just accessible within the community and be provided through the intensive case management. The funding streams for these community-based services are diverse and include county mental health services, including those provided through specialty mental health services funded by MediCal, and through the MHSA program.",0.0
False,,"Some of these community based services are targeted specifically to veterans, such as employment or benefits advocacy, and some are available to the general population. And so on that page one of handout three, you'll see that there's four kind of general areas where services are being provided, either directly to veterans, or to the general population. Either through the Affordable Care Act, through general localized services, or through the VA. For residents who qualify for VA services, connections are also made to VA services that include physical health, mental health, and substance abuse services, as well as employment services.",0.0
False,,"This rich federal resource is an additional asset to qualifying VHHP residents. And a new resource that I just alluded to, through the Affordable Care Act in California's Medicaid expansion, provides single tenants now qualifying for healthcare services funded by MediCal. We anticipate increased flexibility in delivering eligible services in housing under California's proposed 1115 Medicaid waiver, which was just approved by the federal government. And the health homes option currently under development by the Department of Healthcare Services.",0.0
False,,"So, finally, it's worth noting here that VHHP service requirements are generally set at a higher standard than other supportive housing programs. The general requirements are highlighted on page two of that same handout that you're looking at right now, handout three on page two. And so this is gonna kind of walk you through some of the minimum service requirements, as well as some of those that are augmented services.",0.0
False,,"So key requirements include higher standards for lead service provider experience. So to ensure a delivery of quality services VHHP projects require lead service providers with experience in providing better eccentric and housing first oriented services. There's a requirement for minimum service requirements that have also been established. In addition, we expect the use of evidence based service practices by the service providers such as, trauma informed care or motivational interviewing. Weve established lower case management ratios and higher level of required credentials for case managers. VHHP requires intensive onsite managers with appropriate staff tenant ratios using qualified leave service provider staff. In addition, services must be tailored to each veteran's needs, so really, customized and individualized service plans. We expect that the case management will bring strong connections to both the VA and community based services. Including primary care and county behavioral health services, whether provided on-site or accessible generally within the community.",0.0
False,,"Finally, in wrapping up the lessons learned, we did see that some areas of the state did not have projects where we had targeted some needs. And based upon our round two applications we do anticipate that we're gonna be closer to meeting those targets in round two.",0.0
False,,"And then lastly we just wanted to acknowledge that a significant number of projects were not funded in the first round and provide a little bit of background on this. We attribute this primarily to really the tight time frames and meeting new and more complex requirements in rating, has already been alluded to. There was a very short time frame in which for folks to get their projects ready and to conform to a new rating and ranking system and the new requirements. In fact, many of the applications or several of the applications that came in actually self scored below our minimum scoring requirements. And so they were aware in applying that they would not be funded.",0.0
False,,"Finally, the target population is difficult to serve. As it takes significant subsidies to complete these projects, they require operating rental subsidies outside of what a normal on supportive housing project would require, so in order to garner that financial support, it needed a little bit more time. So we do anticipate that in round two that we're going to see that turn around.",0.0
False,,"So now, let me now turn to round two. Following the first round, the state agencies held three public meeting to solicit feedback, in Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, with video conferencing available in a number of cities as well. Feedback on the basic program design was mostly positive all though there was a fair amount of criticism of the application process both in terms of the complexity of the forms and the way in which the supportive services were scored.",0.0
False,,"In addition, the state agencies conducted four in person application workshops for the second round in Oakland, Riverside, San Diego, and Los Angeles, as well as one application workshop that was web based. As a result of the feedback that we received, we made minor amendments to the round one guidelines, focusing primarily on clarifying and streamlining the application process.",0.0
False,,"And you can see a summary of specific changes that were made in the handout number six in your packet. In some, the application scoring was simplified as I mentioned and made more transparent. In connection with this change, the scoring advantage for supportive housing was increased. We clarified that case management is eligible operating expenses, along with resident services coordination.",0.0
False,,"The scoring for rental subsidies now gives credit to projects that can deliver very low rents without the need for external rent, or operating subsidies. And then finally we added a section, on non-mandatory best practices in design and property management that focuses on resident's safety. In terms of the round two applications, you can find a summary of that information in handout number five.",0.0
False,,"In mid-December 2015, we received 34 applications, representing $180 million in requests for what we have now, which is $75 million to allocate. Although we're at the early stages of a review, we've provided a preliminary data sheet for your reference as I mentioned in handout number five.",0.0
False,,"In general, this round of applications is more consistent with the program's geographic targeting, as I mentioned, with increased participation from San Diego and the Bay Area, where we saw fewer applications than we would have liked to have seen in the first round. We also see an increased use of VASH and project base housing twist vouchers and continue to see a majority of VHHP units as supportive housing units that are deeply targeted to disabled veterans experiencing chronic homelessness or other types of homelessness.",0.0
False,,We also see mixed income housing and housing projects proposed for veteran families and senior veterans at a higher rate. These preliminary figures seem to indicate strong demand for the program and are very consistent with the principles that articulated earlier in my remarks. There's a participation from a wide geography and a willingness to more deeply target the most vulnerable veterans to provide supportive services.,0.0
False,,"As next steps, we'll be providing preliminary scoring feedback to applicants in February with final awards to be made in spring of 2016. So before I close and turn it over to Tia, I just wanted to take the opportunity to say thank you to all of those who have been instrumental in creating the VHHP program. First and foremost, are the members of the Legislature who are you're vision and commitment to ensuring the success of the program, both in it's design and it's ongoing evaluation.",0.0
False,,"In addition both CAPSA and corporations for support of housing deserve a dab of gratitude for their leadership in sponsoring AB39. In addition, the program stakeholders and our key partners in federal, state, and local governments are really key to the successful implementation of the program as well as the on going evaluation ff the program to ensure that we can continue to successfully fund projects to serve our most dire veteran housing and services needs. With that I will close and turn it over Diane. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,Good afternoon. Thank you for inviting me here today. I'm Sharon Rapport.,0.0
False,,I'm with the Corporation for Supportive Housing. CSH is a national non profit and community development financial institution working to end homelessness.,0.0
False,,"We offer loans and grants, technical assistance, systems change, and research around models of housing and services for highly vulnerable populations, including veterans.",0.0
False,,"CSH was a cosponsor of Assembly Bill 639, and we did work on passing Proposition 41. First, I'd like to congratulate the Legislature and Governor for passing what is a landmark legislation for creating rental housing projects for Veterans and their families.",0.0
False,,"And, I'd also like to thank the three state departments for putting together thoughtful guidelines and for welcoming stakeholder feedback. And I think they have listened very thoughtfully to that stakeholder feedback.",0.0
False,,"We support the guidelines as a whole. The guidelines prioritize supportive housing, and we do think this initial prioritization of supportive housing makes a lot of sense.",0.0
False,,"Though we do support the need for more affordable housing for veterans who are just becoming homeless or who are risk of homelessness, an initial prioritization for supportive housing makes sense, given that veterans are more vulnerable to becoming homeless and are far more likely to be chronically homeless than other people who fall into homelessness.",0.0
False,,The priority is basic to achieving the initial goals of VHHP and reducing or eliminating homelessness among veterans in California. The guidelines also endorse Housing First Approach and I know several people have mentioned that. I just wanted to explain a little bit more of what that means.,0.0
False,,"Housing First is an evidence based model that recognizes that ending homelessness begins with offering homeless veterans a safe, decent place to live before services can be effective.",0.0
False,,And that place to live should be an independent apartment that has no limit on the length of how long that veteran and their family could live there.,0.0
False,,"Housing First reduces barriers highly vulnerable veterans have in getting healthy, while significantly decreasing the risk of a veteran's return to homelessness.",0.0
False,,"This approach aligns VHHP with federal policies recognized in the VA's Supportive Housing Program, and other U.S. veteran's programs, as well as HUD programs.",0.0
False,,"It also aligns with studies that show the effectiveness of permanent housing in reducing returns to homelessness. Housing First, however, is not housing only. And the guidelines balance the need for quality evidence based services that worked in the veteran's long term experience with homelessness.",0.0
False,,Research shows services offered voluntarily at housing are effective in moving veterans who've experienced long term homelessness into housing stability.,0.0
False,,"And these services include client centered case management, which we think is essential for anybody who has experienced long term homelessness, but particularly for veterans.",0.0
False,,"And again, this is tenant centered, using motivational interviewing and a harm reduction strategy that engages veterans who are otherwise highly distrustful of health care and veteran systems.",0.0
False,,"Care coordination that links veterans to medical mental health and evidence based substance use treatment services, as well as services that may be available to them as veterans.",0.0
False,,"Training on life skills, money management and basic tenancy for veterans, some of whom have been homeless for decades. And working with property managers and tenants to resolve conflicts and avoid eviction. These are the core services that are shown to reduce returns to homelessness and stabilize veterans in housing.",0.0
False,,"CSH has worked for over a decade to secure a sustainable source of services funding and housing in California, and unfortunately we have not yet succeeded. So we know that services funding is one barrier to creating more supportive housing units in this state.",0.0
False,,"However, we did prepare, in preparation for VHHP, we did convene a work group to identify existing services funding, and the work group identified several funding sources. So at the risk of repeating some of what Ms. Riggs offered in her testimony, I'm just gonna explain some of these services funding sources.",0.0
False,,"In some counties, the VA contracts with local, non profit service providers to provide case management services to veterans through the HUD VASH program. We're hoping that the VA expands this community based provider model to all VA medical centers in California.",0.0
False,,"In addition to VASH, the VA funds also the Homeless Patient Aligned Care Teams, which provide and coordinate healthcare veterans may need, Healthcare for Homeless Veterans, which offers outreach and case management services to chronically homeless veterans, and Supportive Services for Veteran's Families, or SSVF, which Ms. Riggs mentioned.",0.0
False,,"And that is available, that program is available to veterans with other than honorable discharge status. SSVF can be used to provide intensive, year long, critical time intervention services to veterans.",0.0
False,,"For those who are not eligible for VA health care benefits or don't have access to SSVF which is not available in all counties in California, many housing providers cobble together operating revenue and philanthropic or private funding to fund services, and I think that's been mentioned here today, as well.",0.0
False,,"Additionally, Federally Qualified, or FQHCs, which are neighborhood based health service providers, often partner with Supportive Housing providers to pay for case management services in Supportive Housing.",0.0
False,,"Projects for Assistance in Transitions from Homelessness, or PATH, is a grant that Federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration oversees. PATH funds services to people with serious mental illness, including those with co occuring substances disorders who are experiencing homelessness or are at eminent risk of becoming homeless.",0.0
False,,You've heard today about Proposition 63 or the Mental Health Services Act. We actually think historically this program has been underused by veterans. But we are seeing an increase in how many veterans are served through the Proposition 63 program.,0.0
False,,"This program funds full service partnerships to residents with serious mental illness, including low staff to client ratios, 24/7 crisis availability, and client centered approaches to recovery.",0.0
False,,"And then finally, some counties, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, are beginning to fund services through their health dollars for homeless people who have frequently used county hospital services. And a good number of veterans are being assisted with this program.",0.0
False,,"In addition to these current resources, CSH has been working with our partners, including HCD, to create new health home benefit to fund services for chronically ill Medi-Cal beneficiaries, and we know a good number of veterans, more than people realize, are Medi-Cal beneficiaries.",0.0
False,,"We expect this benefit will fund a significant range of services and supportive housing, and that it will help VHHP residents become stable.",0.0
False,,"And then we've heard earlier today about the 11-15 Medicaid waiver, which we do hope that some counties utilize to provide opportunities for counties to access federal funds to provide services in housing.",0.0
False,,"There was a federal grant that was announced earlier today for states to be able to fund services in housing as well, and we're hoping that California takes advantage of that grant.",0.0
False,,"I'm not suggesting that we have adequate funds for services in supportive housing, but housing providers are able to create quality supportive housing currently using these existing funding sources.",0.0
False,,"They're able to do this in a way that significantly reduces inpatient stays, emergency room visits, incarceration and ambulance services among veterans and others with significant barriers to housing stability. These projects improve mental health outcomes, substance use treatment services, and quality of life.",0.0
False,,"And over 90% of residents in supportive housing, some of whom have been labeled as incorrigible in other more restrictive housing programs.",0.0
False,,"Stay stably housed after a year, over 83% stay stably housed after two years.",0.0
False,,The biggest challenge housing providers face in cobbling together this complex array of funding sources are the fact that these sources each prioritize different populations.,0.0
False,,"Given the restrictions funding sources already imposed, we strongly advise against legislation that would prioritize one population of homeless veterans over another or that would hamstring the ability of housing providers to use this source of funding flexibly to serve veterans with the greatest need.",0.0
False,,Programs with successful outcomes have always implemented a competitive application process and award the best projects serving highly vulnerable populations.,0.0
False,,"With the clarifications around scoring, we believe that the current guidelines do a really good job in awarding funds to quality projects that planned to serve highly vulnerable veterans.",0.0
False,,"The guidelines already require, for example, serving vets through coordinated entry systems that prioritize people with the greatest need, including those most likely to die on the streets, as Senator Nielsen talked about in his community.",0.0
False,,"We want to avoid that happening, and so the requirements that target people with the most likelihood of dying on the streets is a good direction that the guidelines include.",0.0
False,,We are not in need of legislation to improve a program that is currently not broken. We have been working with the departments to improve scoring for service providers. We agree that there are some issues here.,0.0
False,,The guidelines reward points for lead service providers with clientele made up of at least 20% of veterans living in units restricted to veterans.,0.0
False,,"We believe this requirement is arbitrary. Some service providers serve hundreds of clients every year, sometimes thousands, while others serve a couple dozen, and so a 20% requirement compares service providers on unequal terms.",0.0
False,,"An example is, Skid Row Housing Trust has 2,000 tenants, providing services to those tenants, if 3% are living in restricted households, that's 60 veterans that they're serving.",0.0
False,,"Another service provider that serves over 20% veterans, if they're serving 50 veterans they're only serving 10 veterans living in restricted units so it's an arbitrary percentage.",0.0
False,,"At the same time, veterans receiving services from highly experienced service providers who do not meet the criteria may have achieved more successful outcomes in serving veterans than clients of other less effective service providers who meet this requirement.",0.0
False,,"Finally since few service providers serve veterans predominantly or exclusively, we believe this incentive favors housing providers in specific geographic areas.",0.0
False,,"Although individual veterans experiencing homelessness may have needs similar to non veterans experiencing homelessness in some regards, we do agree Ms. Gun that Service Providers must understand the unique challenges veterans face and how to address their health, housing, and employment needs.",0.0
False,,"Service providers should understand military experience, trauma, and other areas of particular relevance to veterans not shared by non-veterans.",0.0
False,,"In addition, providers should have an understanding of the range of services and benefits available to veterans. And finally, all lead service providers in supportive housing projects should also have experience with the housing-first approach and supportive housing projects.",0.0
False,,"Not only should providers be culturally competent in serving veterans, they should also be culturally competent in serving homeless Californians.",0.0
False,,We hope that the Department for Training and Cultural Competency for strong service providers who lack either of these competencies. Thank you very much for inviting me here and I look forward to your questions.,0.0
False,,"Good afternoon Chairs, Senators, thank you for inviting me today.",0.0
False,,"So, yes, bottom line we are gravely concerned about the sustainability of the projects and ensuring that the services are fully funded over the life of the development, as Ms. King mentioned. The housing that's being constructed with the Prop 41 funds are required to maintain covenants on the affordability requirements for 55 years.",0.0
False,,"And many of the services' funding sources that have been identified and attached to the development projects do not maintain for that period of time, as has been discussed. So, you know, I think what we're doing right now is we're trying to look at ways to structure the overall funding of the project, in order to allow for additional cash flow. You know, I mentioned allowing for a mix of incomes within a project that allows for additional cash flow.",0.0
False,,"Many of the populations that are being served really don't produce income in the project, in order to support the ongoing services that are required in order to keep them appropriately housed and provide the services that are necessary to keep them stable. And so, by providing a mix of incomes, you can kind of pull out that operating income in order to provide those services.",0.0
False,,"That's really a model based upon the funding structure of the entire project. It doesn't work for all populations, and so we have to be sensitive to that. The federal government, both the VA and HUD are partners that we're working very closely with to ensure that the resources that are available and can be attached to the projects are being attached.",0.0
False,,"VASH has been referred to several times during the dialogue, and we're continuing to work with the federal government to see if we can identify more resources.",0.0
False,,You are correct.,0.0
False,,"Not directly for the VHHP program. So, the VHHP program is reserved for the capital improvements-",0.0
False,,associated with the housing. But not-,0.0
False,,"Yeah, we are creating a set of metrics that go well beyond what we would normally be evaluating the success of the projects on. But typically with supportive housing we are the developer sponsors, the support service providers, have identified a number of factors to evaluate the overall success of the outcomes for the residents of the project.",0.0
False,,"We've really augmented those and are continuing to augment those for the VHHP program to ensure that we're getting successful outcomes. The obligation to do that is part of the agreement that we enter into with the development sponsor, that they collect that data on a regular basis. We work very closely with the continuum of care organizations at the local level that really evaluates through a set of data outcomes within the homeless population, generally within their community.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, we are requiring an annual report on the metrics. But in addition to that, we regularly, through our asset management division, do on-site visits that, in this particular program, would include ensuring that the metrics associated with the service provisions, service outcomes are being met.",0.0
False,,We would be glad to do that.,0.0
False,,"So we have, and I'll let Ms. Gunn augment my response, but we have received a number of legal opinions in regards to any fair housing issues related to having gender specific housing. Certainly where there's been a preponderance of military sexually related trauma that, as you mentioned, is generally gonna be in the female gender and, therefore, in order ensure the safety and security and mental well-being of the population, you know, ideally you have a gender specific development.",0.0
False,,"And so we, at this point, have a legal opinion that states that we really will have to evaluate on a case by case basis if folks come forward with a gender specific development as to, you know, the types of services that are necessarily in order to address underlying service needs of that population and the needs for ensuring a gender specific development.

False,,"I'm sorry, if I could just. I'm sorry, I just wanted to chime in on your question around engagement of participants in services.

False,,"I think that the key here is that a development sponsor typically has a development in the queue for, at a minimum 18 months, 24 months, 36 months.

False,,"that takes awhile, and especially because we were forcing marriages, new marriages between service providers, and case managers, and the development community, and so because it was such a condensed process and the developments that came in round one and probably in round two had been in the queue for quite some time.

False,,"I think we have, as Tia just mentioned, we have allowed some additional creativity in the larger loan limits for the supportive housing for extremely low income folks in order to reduce some of the operating costs that are needed to continue the sustainability of that capital investment, but outside of that, I mean we have pretty significant limitations on what we can use the funding for.",0.0

False,,"So you might have some MHSA and VHHP in a single project, but not in a single unit.",0.0
False,,"And I think that the inverse is also true in terms of overlaying the image to say on the vet units. You know, that it will limit the types of veterans that can be served.

False,,"Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On behalf on the California Legislative Black Caucus, we too are here to honor a great American. Dr. Martin Luther King is one of the best examples of serving leadership the world has ever known. He was born 87 years ago. He died at the age of 39, he was slain at the age of 39.",0.0
False,,"So many of you know, yesterday was my birthday, and I turned 59. And to realize what this young man did in 39 years, and what I've just striving to do in my 59 years, humbled me in ways you'll never know.

If you look at who works on those derricks, you don't see a whole lot of black and brown people.

False,,"He did not want black and brown to be fighting with one another. We would be remiss if we continued the kind of race-baiting and fighting, cuz that's what Dr. King died for.

False,,"Thank you very much, Chair Bonilla, Chair Bonta, Chair Dodd. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak here today regarding the new medical marijuana regulation and safety act I am Awet Kidane, and I am the Director of the Department of Consumer Affairs. Before I go into the implementation I want to provide this body some background and context into my Department of consumer affairs. As some of you may know, the primary mission of the department is consumer protection.",0.0
False,,"We currently oversee 41 boards and bureaus that issue licenses in over 250 categories. With the passage of the act, my department is now responsible for establishing the Bureau of Medical Marijuana, which will license and regulate dispensaries, distributors, and transporters. In partnership with my colleagues, the Department of Food and Agriculture, and the Department of Public Health, I will continue to directly oversee the formation of policy and regulations related to medical cannabis.",0.0
False,,"We will work closely to implement the new act by January 1, 2018. Let's be clear, this is an aggressive timeline and for that very reason, I asked my staff to begin the work of implementation immediately after the bills were signed. Early on, our focus has been on education. In order to fully understand the industry that the department is now mandated to regulate, we have been actively engaging our partner agencies, industry experts, and local government. Additionally, in partnership with the Department of Food and Agriculture, we have already received demonstrations from various companies with track and trade systems and identified some potential high level business leads for an IT solution.",0.0
False,,"To accomplish the implementation we have identified by 2018, we have broken this into four phases. The first phase is hiring staff necessary to promulgate regulations in the first phase. The second is developing those regulations. The third is the information technology implementation or IT solution. The fourth and final phase is licensing and enforcement. In phase one, we have focused on hiring staff to draft the necessary regulations and hold stakeholder meetings.",0.0
False,,"We have already been working with the Department of Finance to identify our initial resource needs and we'll be hiring staff over the next coming months. During the second phase, we will develop and notice the regulations. I'm committed to making this process open and transparent with a focus on stakeholder engagement. My staff has already been reaching out to the public at industry events and has encouraged involvement in the development of regulations.",0.0
False,,"By engaging public stakeholders before we formally notice all interested parties, we have an opportunity to provide insight and understanding of the industry and local government and also for those parties to understand what a regulatory entity is, so there is thought sharing back and forth. Once regulations are drafted and publicly noticed, the department at that point will likely get a better understanding and a sense of our internal business requirements of a IT solution.",0.0
False,,"That leads me to the third phase, members. At this point, we will focus on IT implementation. Once we have a sense of the regulatory requirements, we will quickly shift focus to implementing our new licensing system. This point this will including hiring additional IT staff and working with our partner licensing agencies to ensure that there is continuity across all of the licensing agencies. The last and final phase, phase four, the department will focus on licensing and enforcement.",0.0
False,,"This will include hiring staff, training and developing the licensing enforcement staff required for this, and finally application intake. Want to be clear members, throughout all of these phases, I will continue to have regular updates regarding the bureau, coordinate with our partner agencies, and communicate with this body and the public. This is a very diverse and exciting industry and we will be working with many stakeholders to get this right. With that, let me thank this body again for allowing me the opportunity to speak and I welcome any questions that you may have.",0.0
False,,"Appreciate that question, Chair Dodd. Absolutely. The importance of an Advisory Committee is they are the subject matter experts and they are the direct representatives of the multiple representatives of the stakeholders. It is no different than advisory committees that I already have in place for some of my larger bureaus. Private, post-secondary, my bureau for security and investigative services. Both serve a very important role. Go to those advisory committees to get information, feedback on very contentious issues, and I can see that playing out here.",0.0
False,,"In addition to underscoring what Undersecretary Huston and Dr. Smith said, I think something that I've Learned through working with the various states, as well as going on tours, It really highlighted to me the need to strike a fine balance between my mandate, which is consumer protection and the regulation of this industry, but also compliance and making sure that we don't over-regulate in our zeal to get things right.",0.0
False,,"That, and my colleagues said it very well as well, requires education. I'm seeking to be very knowledgeable in this, but there are people much smarter than I that you will hear from, that I seek counsel from. We seek counsel from each other, and through that process, it's gonna help guide our hand in the promulgation of regulations. I would say that is one of the most important things through this process is striking that fine balance and communication.",0.0
False,,"Madam Chair, thank you for that question, very good question, and it's relevant across, almost all of my licensing population. The question of training as the fields evolve, as technology improves, etc., training is very relevant. So, generally, I would say training is absolutely vital.",0.0
False,,"Training of what and how is yet to be determined until we start promulgating regulations, having a clear understanding of what we're regulating, how we're gonna regulate it, how specific these regs are gonna be, what's gonna be required. And then the gap between the regulations and the population will point a very clear light on where that training should fill in. The method by which, is yet to be determined. But, very good question, and is something that we eye across DCA. I'm sure my colleagues to my left do the same thing in their jurisdiction as well.",0.0

False,,"I wanna raise two issues very quickly. One is to echo the concerns about banking, it is ironic that as we shove, as Mercer shoves the medical marijuana industry into the sunshine, the money behind it all remains in the shadows. We must do something about it as aggressively as possible.",0.0
False,,"It's a challenging issue, we know it's not easy to fix. But we need to take time this year doing what we can to fix it this year. The second issue which has not been raised at all is an issue relative to extraction. It may be an issue we're dealing with solely in San Jose. I'm not sure.",0.0
False,,"But San Jose has concerns about criminal law in California that basically says it's a criminal violation to extract the properties out of marijuana. It's and issue that we need to take care of so that we can make sure that as this industry matures, and we're doing more and more away from combustible marijuana, that we're not shutting ourselves up by making people criminally liable. Appreciate the time and look forward to working with you. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Jennifer Coon, Legislative Analyst Office, I think that's one of the things we're trying to point out as one of the difficulties you face in looking at the teacher workforce, is it fluctuates and with a very strong relationship to state funding. And so the state goes through a recession, you see this environment where there are pink slips. It doesn't look like you'll be able to be stably employed right after you finish your teacher prep program.",0.0
False,,"And so you see this dip in enrollments. But you also see some teachers that do finish programs that can't get jobs, and so what you're facing now is what happened to those teachers. Can we encourage them to be sort of re-attracted to the teaching profession?",0.0
False,,"And given we don't know what's on the horizon, when the next recession will come. What if we implement certain strategies now? Will they be effective by the time we want them to be? You face these really sort of big tensions between the state environment and your sort of responses to dealing with changes in the work force.",0.0
False,,"You know this, but California does have generous financial aid, so about half of college students do graduate without debt. Those who do graduate, the other half, carry on average what you mentioned in this range of 20, $25,000 in debt. Whether that is precluding teachers, I don't know if the evidence bears that, because also as you mentioned, they sort of realized going into the profession the salary schedule's very clear, they know what they'll get paid typically at their local district.",0.0
False,,"Many of them stay local so states across the country have tried things like signing bonuses, differential salary schedules. There might be things that once they become teachers will help them over the long run and or encourage them after they've gotten through their prep program to stay maybe longer than they otherwise would have.",0.0
False,,"The state could consider things like measuring, sort of publicizing teacher turn over rates a little bit more than maybe they do already, maybe differences in districts and see if they can help districts with higher turn over rates.",0.0
False,,"You know what, Dan's been spending a lot of time pouring over the research. And what's difficult for us is almost every time you find a program that works in this state, a loan forgiveness program, you find another state where it didn't work. And the ingredients to the program seem somewhat similar, so do loan forgiveness programs work? One worked in Florida.",0.0
False,,"Our program didn't have stellar results. We were asked to look at that last year. Do grants work? Well grants certainly help folks cover the cost of their teacher prep programs. Would they have otherwise been teachers? We don't know. We're sort of guessing as to whether the grant made a significant difference. And because of all this other factors, economic development, state funding, pink slips,it's hard to really control for these isolated effects.",0.0
False,,"One of the most robust findings is that salary differentials tend to help, and not support programs, particularly for beginning teachers, tend to help. California for decades had a support program, explicitly, the state created the rules. When it developed the Local Control Funding Formula it kept that money and gave it to districts and said now we're gonna hold you accountable through student results, and through measuring missed assignments. It still has the money there, it's just a little less prescriptive today.",0.0
False,,"And there in the L caps a few, like one teacher, related, tell us about your mis-assigned teachers, but again, there's some concern that L caps are already complicated, and so another tension before you. If you wanted to give some teacher dynamics a higher profile, within the L cap, how might you do that?",0.0
False,,"Yeah, again, we have been looking at these. I don't know if there's a single great meta study and California itself hasn't done a meta study. In terms of looking at, California itself has had loan forgiveness grant programs, support programs for beginning teachers, for veteran teachers. We've tried to offer incentives for districts to develop alternative compensation schedules.",0.0
False,,"We've evaluated as a state some of those programs, but we haven't said what the dollar for the grant program would be less effective than the dollar for the support program. I'm not aware of any study out there in the country that does that sort of comparative analysis. If we only have $1, where would be the next place that we'd put it?",0.0
False,,"That's our challenge. We're trying to help the state figure out where that next dollar should go and the best we can sort of say is we think salary differentials and support programs work. With the state has done the support stuff, has evaluated it, has found that it to be effective, still has money for many districts, still doing what they are doing with it. And then the salary differentials are just much more difficult as this say willing to pay special a teachers more or science teachers more does not wanna embark on that conversation. Now having said that, one final comment.",0.0
False,,"The state for a while had wanted to develop a teacher longitudinal database, which would have allowed the state to do workforce studies. How long are teachers? Which kinds of teachers are staying and which kinds of districts? Which ones seem to be trying some things we could learn from? We don't, it was dismantled a number of years ago, but it could be one way where you could in California be doing more sort of periodic assessment of what might be working.",0.0
False,,"And the federal government does sample. Teachers every four years, they sample California teachers as part of that endeavor. We requested the data, so my colleague, we have access to that as an office. We're trying to explore.  It does tell us, for example, why teachers leave. So apps in the California database, it's the best we've got right now. We're trying to cull it.",0.0

I've been asked to describe Housing First and give a little bit of background about Housing First programs at the state level in California. Housing First is an evidence-based model intended to end homelessness by housing homeless people as quickly as possible without precondition.",0.0
False,,"A psychiatrist in New York, Sam Tsemberis, created the Housing First model in 1992, based on the premise that homeless people cannot address healthcare needs until and unless they are housed in permanent, stable place to live. Since then, research has proven Sam Tsemberis correct.",0.0
False,,"We know that housing is the single biggest indicator of the ability of somebody to improve health outcomes, both on the medical side and behavioral healthcare side. And we know that to be true in California as well. One study in California for example that looked at MediCal beneficiaries showed homeless beneficiaries continued to increase their inpatient cost while homeless,",0.0
False,,Services promote housing stability and engage and educate tenants on avoiding risky behaviors and connect tenants to evidence-based treatment. And tenants have a lease and enjoy all the rights and responsibility of tenancy. Housing First programs fund two key strategies and both of the earlier witnesses talked about both.,0.0
False,,"For 30% of homeless people who are experiencing chronic homelessness in California or who are cycling between institutional settings and homelessness, supportive housing is the proven intervention and the appropriate intervention. Supportive housing, as you've heard, offers long term rental assistance that helps people in deep poverty afford their housing and provides intensive wrap around services to help keep them stably housed.",0.0
False,,"Studies over the last 20 plus years demonstrate supportive housing is less costly to public systems than chronic homelessness. And keeps over 90% of tenants stably housed over long periods of time, even among those who have been homeless for decades. For the remaining 70% of people who could exit homelessness without long term assistance, rapid rehousing is a proven highly effective intervention.",0.0
False,,"Many of our smaller counties and Central Valley and Northern California counties, employ Housing First as well. Fresno, for example, prioritized Section 8 vouchers for chronically homeless residents. And they were able to decrease chronic homelessness by 25% over two years. So these strategies really do work across counties in California.",0.0
False,,"Some smaller counties have struggled with using capital funds because fewer developers have capacity to build there. The cost of housing is less and the economic gain of development is lower. In these communities, we also need money for technical assistance and capacity building, to apply for funding and to attract developers where available housing stock is lacking.",0.0

Thank you and I'll look forward to your questions.",0.0
False,,"I could take a stab, and others can join. So I really do think we do need capital funding. Because most of our communities, we do not have even as Phil Ansell was talking about, even if all of the housing authorities in the County of Los Angeles put their turnover vouchers to create supportive housing, we'd still have a gap.",0.0
False,,"It wouldn't fill the incomplete need, and we've seen in California that people are staying homeless longer. We have the highest rate of chronic homelessness in the country. About a third of all chronically homeless people live here in California.",0.0
False,,"And the reason is, is because we don't have enough housing that's affordable to people in deep poverty. So there are more people coming into the homeless system as people are getting housed out of homelessness. There are more people becoming homeless. And I think Phil's PowerPoint about prevention is really true that we need to shut the front door as well as the backdoor, open the backdoor.",0.0
False,,"But I think that requires some capital investment to create more housing that's affordable to people specifically in deep poverty. And that really would allow us to create more housing opportunities for those who need supportive housing. It would help us create more housing opportunities for people who are on the verge of homelessness and would fall into homelessness but for that housing, so I think that's one key piece.",0.0
False,,"But I also think, as several of the speakers have mentioned, we need other strategies as well, landlord incentives to get landlords to take housing vouchers. There are a number of housing authorities in the State of California who are not leasing all of the housing vouchers that they have because we don't have enough landlords willing to take them.",0.0
False,,"It's difficult to rent to somebody with a voucher. So, trying to provide some grants to local communities to offer some incentives to landlords would be another way to create a pool of landlords willing to take vouchers. That would allow us to fully use those federal subsidies that right now a lot of them are being left on the table.",0.0
False,,"I think also funding for services, we have been working to create a sustainable funding source through Medi-Cal for services in support of housing. We haven't gotten there yet. So I think continuing those efforts that would allow us to tap into federal funding, particularly for, since we have Medi-Cal expansion for those indigent adults who can access Medi-Cal now, could get funded.",0.0
False,,"Those could be funded, services could be funded largely through federal funding. Again, we're not tapping into that funding sufficiently now, and I'm hoping that there are opportunities that lie ahead that allow us to do that. And then finally, I really do think we need some funding for rental subsidies.",0.0
False,,"And that can be done through tracking data around our Medi-Cal savings. Medi-Cal saves a lot of money, and most of the money that it saves is at the state level and the federal level. We don't know how much right now Medi-Cal is saving by moving people into supportive housing.",0.0
False,,"But if we can find a way to track how much we are saving in Medi-Cal by moving people into supportive housing and then use those savings to pay for ongoing rental subsidies, that would help us address, fill the gap that Phil and others have mentioned.",0.0

Once housed, these same individuals were able to decrease dramatically their emergency room use, their inpatient admissions and the length of their inpatient stays when they were admitted. Other studies similarly link Housing First to reduce recidivism, increase income and reunification with kids in foster care.",0.0
False,,"Housing First has several key components. Housing should not be contingent on participation in services. Landlords accept applicants regardless of sobriety, treatment completion or good credit or rental history. Similarly, once housed, a tenant's use of alcohol or drugs in their own apartment, as long as they're complying with their lease terms should not be a basis for eviction.",0.0
False,,"And it is a much lower cost intervention than supportive housing. Rapid rehousing combines short to medium term rental assistance, move-in cost and voluntary services to help exit people from homelessness and get households back on their feet. The services include locating a place to live that is affordable once the housing transitions off of the short to medium term rental assistance.",0.0
False,,"And studies show that 92 to 94% of families and individuals receiving rapid rehousing are able to stay stably housed, no return to homelessness. In California, the Proposition 41 and emergency solutions grant program that Cindy Cavanagh is going to discuss later, as well as the Housing Supports program that Trent Rhorer is going to discuss in a few minutes.",0.0
False,,"They both rely on Housing First strategies and supportive and rapid re-housing. A budget item you'll be considering this year, Bringing Families Home, would fund supportive housing and rapid re-housing. For homeless child welfare involved families experiencing homelessness. And it employs both support of housing and rapid re-housing strategies.",0.0
False,,"Both of these strategies rely on either the availability of sufficient apartments affordable to people in poverty., or enough housing vouchers and enough landlords willing to accept these vouchers to help people get into permanent place to live. Neither of these options are available and enough supply in most communities in California. We need landlord incentives to promote full use of existing vouchers.",0.0
False,,"We need strategies like Phil and Sal talked about of using, prioritizing our existing vouchers for people experiencing homelessness.

False,,"Good afternoon. My name is Kevin Aslanian and I'm with the Coalition of California Welfare Rights Organizations. And I think we should support what the supervisor said that we should look at why the CalWORKS recipients become homeless, children become homeless. Often, they become homeless because the CalWORKS program is infested with penalties and sanctions. And when they're penalized, their benefits go down that is less than the rent and utilities.",0.0
False,,"But the penalty goes into effect and the family becomes vulnerable to homelessness. One of the very simple fixes if that happens, the penalty doesn't go into effect. Because it will put the families into homelessness. The other big problem is that the CalWORKS Homeless Assistance program is only limited to once in their lifetime.",0.0

False,,"It was police brutality, it was the poverty of a community, and inequality at that time.

False,,"The Watts revolt was a reaction to systemic racial injustice including abusive police practices and a defacto segregation of Los Angeles, which further limited access by black Americans to education, economic opportunity, and housing.

False,,"But we have found that almost every county is serving less than 20% of their eligible population, assuming those low income families.

Maybe it goes up to 40% at the extreme.",0.0
False,,We don't have a good way of knowing what the demand is because we don't have the centralized eligibility list anymore.,0.0
False,,"Yes. Well, we think getting a better handle on demand is very important, in terms of understanding the eligible population. But, as Virginia walked through the underlying structures that California has today, we would argue, even if we don't have great information on demand, the Legislature could get started in proving that structure.",0.0
False,,"Once the state were to have better data on demand it would make it all that much easier to try to equalize slots across counties, for example.",0.0
False,,"There's actually, it's a quite difficult question to answer because of the structures the state has in place today. So if the state is paying these title five direct contract centers that have the developmentally appropriate requirements loves less today than this other. Then it raises this question.",0.0
False,,"Well, how much does it cost to provide that level of care? But we have, even though the regional market rate, the voucher rates, the title 22 rates, on average, are higher today. And so Virginia's indicating it would cost some money, to get to those higher rates, but then I think, also embedded in your question is well, what if we're asking more of those providers?",0.0
False,,Is there an additional amount we would need to provide? And that's sort of up for debate. You could provide some one time money to get existing providers better qualified if you were to raise the requirements you're placing on them. But it's not entirely clear from the evidence you would have to pay a higher rate for that.,0.0
False,,"You could just end the adjustment, and keep with the rate structure you have on the voucher side. It could be enough to do what you're asking them to do.",0.0
False,,"And so, as some of you might recall, childcare has been in and out of 98 and different slices of it over time have been in, out, and in. And we as an office haven't made pronouncements on the right place for putting it.",0.0
False,,"Our general concern has just been that you have policy rational for doing it, and that you treat the programs consistently over time.",0.0
False,,"And this year under the governor's proposals and our assessment of this proposals, he has no major shifting in and out.",0.0
False,,"There are also sort of complicated interactions between eligible population and the market. So for example on the contract side we have CD a lot, contract to counties, particular providers a certain number of slots. If they can't be met, then they reallocate those to centers that do have capacity.",0.0
False,,"So some of it's being driven by the capacity and the willingness, desire of providers to open around the state. And that can be driven by factors that aren't necessarily just, I have an eligible population to serve. They can be driven by, I've got private pay clients in the area and I've so got some subsidized clients, I can make ends meet. So as much of child care is sort of a more complicated answer.",0.0
False,,"It hasn't entirely been driven by state policy to have these inequities, it's just the way the state has done business has allowed them to materialize.",0.0
False,,"Yes, the state would have to consider the capacity, the rules, how it defines eligibility, how it makes payments. These things would be intertwined to actually do the equalization, where the state to decide it wanted to head in that direction.",0.0
False,,"For our 2004 report we made a few maps to try to share with you, but became a little uncomfortable because the underlying data, because we don't have this perfect match between low income and working families, so we decided not to include. So the best we have is that, about 20% of the eligible population, less than that across counties is being served.",0.0
False,,We do know more eligible children are served in San Francisco than in Tulare. The Bay Area than the Central Valley. But we weren't quite confident we could have gradations that were so fine that they would give you much more than that.,0.0
False,,"So there are a variety of things that are happening. I think were you to look just at state funding, you would still see differences across counties because of these things we were mentioning a moment ago, where contracted slots or voucher slots, how they were distributed by the state over the course of decades. You'll also find differences in how counties pooled together federal funding,",0.0
False,,"first five funding, private funding. And so those will also, in some cases, magnify the differences across counties. So, for example, the Bay Area is making a concerted effort to combine first five with some federal money they received with state money. And that's happening to some extent in other places, I'm sort of guessing, but I think LA is doing some of that.",0.0
False,,"I don't think to the same extent, and then you'll have rural areas who are probably doing it far less.",0.0
False,,"I don't know. There's much compliance in child care, so the federal government is looking very carefully at how Head Start providers are delivering service. The state is looking very carefully at how State preschool is being delivered and",0.0
False,,"has its own compliance monitoring system that checks their books. And the voucher program has AP agencies, and the state and community care licensing that are checking, both that they're meeting standards and their books. I think what we're getting at is, because the data's just not so great, and we were talking about the cells a little bit earlier with the waiting list,",0.0
False,,unfortunately we don't know as much about the service population and any duplication in programs in terms of a child being served clear multiple. That's what's making that difficult to know exactly the share of the eligible population served across the state.,0.0
False,,"Well, so by design, no. By design, California is saying we will have these Title V centers, and we'll send out CDE. And we'll do compliance monitoring and make sure they're meeting developmentally appropriate standards. We just won't do that for a whole series of other centers.",0.0
False,,"We'll send out community care licensing. They'll ensure health and safety, they won't be checking developmental components. So by design, California is allowing very similar children to get access to different care at different rates, with different standards, with potentially different providers.",0.0
False,,"Yes, it's our understanding across counties, there are differences in the way they're intermingling funds to offer their programs.",0.0
False,,And just one comment.,0.0
False,,"So on the LAO side, we're suggesting nothing occur for families and providers in 16-17. So, if there is a four year old out there and their family is thinking there's a TK option for them in the fall, we're suggesting, encouraging you to think about leaving that in place.",0.0
False,,"There's still lots of decisions, policies at the Legislature could put in place to give those three year olds, those families a year heads up as to what their program might look like a year from now, because both on the preschool and the child care side, we think there are significant flaws with the existing policies. As you are hearing, the administration isn't offering you much detail.",0.0
False,,"Whether its now or a few months from now or next season, we would just encourage you to think about what program do you want? What kind of eligibility criteria providers that ultimately you as policy makers will want to probably take the reins of this and decide what programs you think are best on both sides.",0.0
False,,"Well, we have heard this concern, obviously. We know of counties, cities that are raising minimum wage or considering it, if they haven't already and I'm sorry that the numbers, I'm not entirely sure, but I think our calculation at $10 was something like $20,000.",0.0
False,,"The cutoff, per year per family, the cutoff here is $42,000. The point being even if I'm wrong on the numbers, which I know I'm wrong, but the full time worker making minimum wage would still qualify. We aren't aware of any example, even at slightly higher minimum wage cutoffs where that family would no longer be eligible for care.",0.0
False,,"Again, I'm going to have the numbers off a bit. But there's something like 80 some percent of families participating in subsidized childcare are single parent families.",0.0

False,,"I think Senator Mitchell and Senator Pan really hit on a key question at the hearing today. And that is, what is the policy goal behind the Early Education Block Grant proposal? If the goal is to overlay the concepts of the Local Control Funding Formula onto the early ed program, we believe that has a lot of merit. But at the same time, we think that as the hearing today illustrated, there are a lot of unanswered questions.",0.0

However the LAO does have a valid point about ensuring that we just don't give you the money and we don't we look around two years later, we don't get what we want, we get kind of the same thing because of whatever.",0.0
False,,And so what I would like to do obviously to hold it over give BSEC and sheriffs to come back to this Committee to show us that you're going to build what you say you're going to build and give us that comfort level. And I will let you know that last year.,0.0

False,,"And I agree with you wholly, completely, and I think Prop 47 addresses that, and there's some other things that we're doing as a Legislature that we voted on.

False,,"Okay, thank you. Mr. Lackey, do you have any questions? For the LAO and, okay.",0.0
False,,"So I want to thank each of you for being here today. It was informative, and I think we definitely know what the need is and how we need to move forward. And so I would like to ask the Department of Finance and LAO's office to come back. Hello. Hi.",0.0
False,,"So let's this time begin, it's more people. We'll begin with the Department of Finance. I guess with a discussion of methodology used to calculate savings. And then we'll have the LAO talk about options for calculating savings. So whoever wants to begin on the Department of Finance side.",0.0
False,,"Okay. If anyone else, finance, so I have a quick question. It's more of a, it just, and unfortunately, the controller's office is not here, and if we'd thought it through. But you were reading something, and you mentioned that the controller has some participation in the calculation.",0.0
False,,"Is it to verify the number, making sure you added the numbers up right. Is it to verify, whether or not the algorithm you used was something that made sense? I have Miss Nora Campos here, who, where the controller or the former controller, decided that she shouldn't get her pay, and it went to court.",0.0
False,,"And so, sometimes the controller can make determinations far and above of what some people think. What is your interpretation of, what they're supposed to do when you came up with your number, that there's both, I guess, verified by August. What is their role?",0.0
False,,"So, you do think they may also make determination on the algorithm, or what the methodology that you used, when they do the audit. Is that what you're saying?",0.0
False,,"Okay, thank you. Now the LAO.",0.0
False,,"Okay. Before I allow my colleagues to ask questions, and especially for the people in the audience, this is probably a normal process for the Department of Finance and the LAO not always to agree on a number. I mean, since we been in the Legislature, I don't think we've ever agreed on the surpluses that are in the budget every year.",0.0
False,,"We're usually higher than the governor's office, so the Legislature and the governor's office aren't always together. I think this year, we're a lot closer than we ever have before since I've been here, so this is not unusual to have that. What I would like, and I think the rest of the community members would like for us to proceed in a logical, systematic, methodical procedure where we look at where we agree.",0.0
False,,"Unfortunately, it look like we don't agree on anything, but that's a whole another discussion. But a $100 million is a big delta.",0.0
False,,"That's a big, big, big number that we're apart. And so hopefully, we can begin to lead the discussion into where we agree or where we can come to compromise so that we can ultimately get the most, as I heard from a lot of the people that testified, we can get to the most transparent methodology that everyone is comfortable with.",0.0
False,,"We may not have full agreement, but we may get to a comfort level that we are abiding by the full spirit of Prop 47. I worry that we proceed, and people are getting the wrong impression of how we proceed and that we're not doing all we can to provide the services that we promised when this bill was approved and that we're not doing anything crazy or is not one of those things where one group says, a dollar for you, a dollar for you, a dollar for me, half a cent for you, $3 for me, and $1 for you.",0.0
False,,"Hopefully, it doesn't look like that and that we eventually are able to get to where we need to go. I have a couple questions, but I'll hold off, because I know Mr. Lackey has been waiting with some questions, so I'll let him begin if he's ready.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Lackey. And if I were to add, as we start to look at savings, and we get more and more savings, hopefully. We probably should look at that so that if any of these Prop 47 savings can go to communities that have had experience and increase in crime that we look at trying to maybe redirect some resources to help blunt that.",0.0
False,,"Especially if it's a direct correlation. And so I agree with you. We should not ignore it. And we should look at it, because that's also part of the calculation. Do we have to expend any more resources because of Prop 47? And I think that's what the courts were saying.",0.0
False,,"Whether it comes from the general fund or from Prop 47, if there's been a rise in court cases, the state needs to help Mitigate that with any funding. I think these gentlemen and ladies are looking at the same thing, Department of Finance and LAO. I think they will definitely make sure that's incorporated so that we blunt any additional crime that's going on as a result of it. Miss Campos?",0.0
False,,"Okay. And, we probably could spend the rest of my time talking about this, so I'm going to make a suggestion to the Committee, that obviously we hold this over, and then I would make a suggestion to both the LAO. Well, let me just ask just one question, and I'm pretty sure the answer would be no. So, are there any areas where you absolutely agree on?",0.0
False,,Okay. How much money is that?,0.0
False,,So it really comes down to costs?,0.0
False,,"In agreement on that.  And so I will have my staff work with both, or the Committee staff work with both, so that we can come back and hopefully get some not only agreement, get more agreement. At some point, the Legislature, I think, will look at not only making a determination or coming back and making a recommendation.",0.0
False,,"This body makes recommendations to the budget, so we may make a recommendation about what we think the numbers are. But I want to make sure that in all fairness to the Department of Finance, because we're Legislature out, it's the higher number. But to that we give you an opportunity to fully vet what you got and we showed that we have value in the input that you give us, even though we liked that other number a lot better.",0.0
False,,"That we come to a reasonable, hopefully, solution to this problem. And I think it's really important that we get there because if we don't have something that's transparent, and this is what I'm really afraid of, more so than whether or not we come up with a number that fit a public into the voter, into residents of the state.",0.0
False,,"That they lose faith in us being able to live up to our commitments. There were some big claims made early on in the Proposition. And one side of us is not even close to it. And so, it's really, really, really important that whatever we move forward with that the residents of California really truly believe that we did everything we could to get to that higher number.",0.0
False,,"I'm just going to be real honest with you. And I think the Legislature even if we have to come up with our own calculations we'll, that we think makes the most sense, or what, more important, what the spirit of Prop 47 what they really wanted.",0.0
False,,"We will make that determination on our side, or make direct recommendation to the budget and ultimately I think both the Assembly and the Senate will come out with the number, but in again I want to make sure that we're all at least talking, we're all working together so we can come to that.  And we'll determine when you come back later. So I want to thank each of you for being here today.",0.0
False,,"And to that, I know you did that, but I'm afraid if I were to ask the LAO to give me their projections it might be close to 210 of 59. And they were backing in the- Exactly. Same position where heading get. And so I appreciate what the Department of Finance said. But we do have to come together. In some way shape or form.",0.0
False,,"Thank you. And we'll bring up the next. Issue number 2, striking law enforcement and community relationship. I'm sorry. I apologize. Public comment. I am so sorry. Public comment. I guess there are a couple people who had to comment.",0.0
False,,"So we're going to keep it down to, God, that's a lot. I'm sorry this went so long. We have a lot of issues so can you just- Not couple.  I'm about to 30 seconds if people keep getting in line, so we'll try one minute and see how far we go, okay.",0.0

False,,"Thank you. So I apologize but I only have time now for you to state your name and where you're from. For the last, the line keeps, it's growing. We'll be here till tomorrow if everybody had another minute. So all I have time for is your name and what organization you're from.",0.0
False,,Can you speak for all of them?,0.0
False,,"Thank you. That's it. One more, this is the last one.",0.0
False,,"Thank you. Now we can go to issue number two. Thank you for hanging in there. Issue number two, Strengthening Law Enforcement and Community Relations Grant Program. The Board of State and Community Corrections will give a brief summary of grant programs, parameters, and update the Subcommittee on current status of the program.",0.0
False,,"So we had the Board of State and Community Corrections, California Police Chief's Association, Chauncee Smith, Legislative Advocate, Civil ACLU, Department of Finance, LAO, and then public comment.",0.0
False,,"Let's get through all the witnesses. ACLU, Chauncee?",0.0
False,,A little short.,0.0
False,,"Okay, the California Police Chiefs Association.",0.0
False,,Thank you. Now the Department of Finance?,0.0
False,,"Thank you, LAO?",0.0
False,,"Okay, any questions from-  Yes, Ms. Campos.",0.0
False,,"And I think too, as we move forward especially if, and we'll have public comment after this. I think this Committee, if you're a successful chief, you're 330 chiefs are successful at reducing racial profiling, racial bias. And just really helping with the whole black life matter problem.",0.0
False,,"With this money, which is where I think you're trying to get to, which I think the ACLU is really concerned about. And I think even the LAL would say, if you're very successful at it, I don't know if the Department of Finance would give me $330 million, but I do believe, if the state and a lot of my colleagues are talking about or putting in laws for racial profiling.",0.0
False,,"Putting in black lives, we're doing in all these mandates and regulations and a lot of it is unfunded. And so in some ways the state may have some liability, but we do have to put some skin in the game. And so we're going to hold this over because we do believe we need to have some, some oversight to ensure that you get, you meet your goals so that whatever the RFP's when they come back, what the LAO's is saying which is really valid.",0.0
False,,"How do we, the Legislature know that this is actually been done and how successful it's been? And obviously it's very successful, we need to keep moving on and doing more of this. And so, we're going to hold it over so we get some more specificity on what your RP is doing.",0.0
False,,"And we have some ways to measure it, because I think it's really important that we show some success, especially from the chief because it starts from the top and then it goes down. Go ahead. Sure.",0.0
False,,Thank you. Any public comment? Ready.,0.0
False,,Thank you. Yes?,0.0
False,,Thank you.,0.0
False,,Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Thank you, and with that, we're going to hold this over, get more information. Thank you very much for testifying today. Thank you.

False,,"Okay, thank you, Lizzie? Yeah. From CURB.",0.0
False,,Thank you.,0.0
False,,"My name is Kevin Asthen, I'm with the Coalition of California Welfare Rights Organizations. And we support bringing SSI up to 100% the Federal poverty level. And also the same should be done for CalWORKS recipients. We're also living on 30% of the federal poverty level and everything we should do is cash out food stamps right now.",0.0
False,,"Every year we leave on the table $1.4 billion and that's every month means SSI recipients don't get $122 million. If we do that, we cash out, we bring in about $4 billion of California. And that will create 40,000 jobs. Thank you.",0.0
False,,Now from Department of Finance.,0.0
False,,"Thank you, LAO?",0.0
False,,Any questions from Committee Members? Mr. Rodriguez?,0.0
False,,"Ms. Campos, do you have anything or, Mr. Lackey?  Okay, here's my dilemma. So about three years ago, I told the County of Los Angeles when they wanted to expand their jail that I wasn't going to give them a dime unless their new jail that they wanted to build, Took into account mental health professionals, psychiatrists, teachers, people to train people to get jobs, and it kept saying beds, beds, beds, and I got angrier and angrier.",0.0
False,,"The Sheriff's Association came in when there was another discussion about getting money for more jails and I told I would never vote for it if it was just more beds and wasn't about rehabilitation. The state, Corey came into my office and no disrespect to Corey, but for the first time, I heard a discussion from the sheriffs in the county about a different type of facility.",0.0
False,,"Not the ones that Kerb is talking about. But one that actually looks at rehabilitation in a comprehensive manner. And so, in some ways, I'm conflicted where I told you this is what I want and you coming back and tell me that I'm going to give you what you want. However the LAO does have a valid point about ensuring that we just don't give you the money and we don't we look around two years later, we don't get what we want, we get kind of the same thing because of whatever.",0.0
False,,And so what I would like to do obviously to hold it over give BSEC and sheriffs to come back to this Committee to show us that you're going to build what you say you're going to build and give us that comfort level. And I will let you know that last year.,0.0
False,,"There were 40 something $1 million given to I guess local chiefs of police and others to do as they wanted to, and this Committee asked them and also the Committee in the Senate asked, what were you going to do with the money? And we didn't get a sufficient answer and as you know, that money was eventually cut out of the budget.",0.0
False,,"It would have been in there if we had gotten a clear answer on what you were going to do with the money. And so, I would strongly recommend, especially for the Committee here and even the ones that are big advocates of yours, if you're not building something that is different from what we normally do.",0.0
False,,"And if you're building something more of what curb is talking about, the chances of it getting through are not going to be very good. And so we're going to hold this over. Hopefully you can get back to us. Some assurances that these are not just regular prison beds, the same old same old. That we're doing something different. Mr. Rodriguez, yes?",0.0
False,,"I'm going to let Ms. Buchen to have the last word, but in part two, these entities or these counties that have not done, that also want to make sure they have a willingness to take on this new way of incarceration. I'm not certain they are 100% behind wanting to do this or are they just going to take the money and build the same old, same old.",0.0
False,,"So, we need some information from them, their willingness to build what we hope will be the way. Before Ms. Buchen closes, I'd just tell you that the board has excellent documents that shows the programs that have been applied for and including the programs that have been successful in bidding for the funding.",0.0
False,,"And we can certainly provide that to you because you'll read it, I think, and you will say, this is not jails for new jail sake. This is, it's replacement beds, community transitional, health care building, some of these buildings have no beds at all. Okay, thank you.",0.0
False,,"And I agree with you wholly, completely, and I think Prop 47 addresses that, and there's some other things that we're doing as a Legislature that we voted on. Reducing mandatory minimums, we're doing that right now and those individuals are the ones that you're talking about. But there are some individuals that need to be incarcerated, without a doubt.",0.0
False,,"I don't think taking Charles Manson out and having him in a facility outside of jail will do anybody any good. So there are individuals that need to be incarcerated and while they're incarcerated, hopefully we can help them, retrain them, get out of criminality and move it in. So that's kind of what we're talking about them and at a low level, non non ones that have drug problems.",0.0
False,,"Absolutely we need places for them to go outside of the jail system where we can actually help them. So I think we can work on both levels. So hopefully we can come to some solution that we can provide funding on both ends. So I want to thank everyone, we're going to hold this over until we get public comment. God, okay.

So it can be a little confusing, when he proposes doing something at a local level.",0.0
False,,"So when is it a local level? When it's not? And you probably can tell from the Legislature's standpoint. We're willing to go ahead and move forward with that, but you know, is it? You have to be a little more consistent, I think, in our evaluation and then the other thing, which I don't think I would get an answer for, there's I guess, there's this feeling that since we got rid of the 40 million, this may be another attempt at cobbling together another 40 million to do the same thing that was done before.",0.0
False,,"I would ask the new finance guy, if that is the case. Is the Governor trying to do a fast one? But I don't want to put him on the spot. You can answer me, nobody's listening, really. So.

False,,That address some of the problems with the elderly abuse and so here's why the recommendation from the chair is going to be no. You're absolutely right. We have to work on the number of people that have gone to the county level and the over crowding there.,0.0

False,,"When people go to jail for a crime, we're trying to rehabilitate them so they don't do it again. When they go to county we do have to put in more programs to reduce the amount of recidivism. When you go to prison, a lot of people get a PhD in how to commit a crime. And so sending people to prison without any type of mechanism to rehabilitate them, will only make them better at their craft and further victimize the most vulnerable in our community.",0.0
False,,"And as a great man once told me, which I hope we would do more of, he criticized the Legislature by saying the Legislature creates laws they don't really create solutions.

False,,"But also making sure that we can figure out a way that people who are victimized, we can get some type of restitution which I believe needs to be done.

False,,"Well you can't. You can't make a dime while you're in prison, and so to have that build up over time didn't make any sense. What made sense is to get people out of prison and become productive citizens so they can make restitution not only to the elderly, but to this community.",0.0

False,,That address some of the problems with the elderly abuse and so here's why the recommendation from the chair is going to be no. You're absolutely right. We have to work on the number of people that have gone to the county level and the over crowding there.,0.0
False,,"In fact, I believe the Governor has put another $250 million in the budget to help with the over crowding and to build more jail facilities, but the most important component of that which is what I think the opponents are trying to address, but they may not have said it well.",0.0
False,,"When people go to jail for a crime, we're trying to rehabilitate them so they don't do it again. When they go to county we do have to put in more programs to reduce the amount of recidivism. When you go to prison, a lot of people get a PhD in how to commit a crime. And so sending people to prison without any type of mechanism to rehabilitate them, will only make them better at their craft and further victimize the most vulnerable in our community.",0.0
False,,"And as a great man once told me, which I hope we would do more of, he criticized the Legislature by saying the Legislature creates laws they don't really create solutions. We really need to focus on how to solve this. And the solving this is dealing with the perpetrators and getting them out of that business.",0.0
False,,"But also making sure that we can figure out a way that people who are victimized, we can get some type of restitution which I believe needs to be done. But I also know when you send someone to prison, just as I put in a bill for whether or not you could pay alimony and child support payments while you're were in prison.",0.0
False,,"Well you can't. You can't make a dime while you're in prison, and so to have that build up over time didn't make any sense. What made sense is to get people out of prison and become productive citizens so they can make restitution not only to the elderly, but to this community.",0.0
False,,"And to give back what they've taken from us. And so while I definitely value everything that you said, and you're absolutely right that we need to do more. We need to do a comprehensive look as one of my esteemed colleagues has said earlier, that it really addressed it and to solve this problem in a big picture.",0.0
False,,And this maybe a component of it. We just need to work together to come up with that. With that I'm recommending a no vote today. And no one's made a motion so-,0.0

False,,The United States preventative task force and Centers for Disease Control recommendations on smoking cessation policies are not reflected in the bill. Specifically counseling is part of a successful smoking cessation program and this bill makes that optional for our enrollees that we purchase and provide care for.,0.0
False,,And so that additional cost to us without that with unlimited smoking equip temps will make it very much more expensive for us to cover. The increased costs the Medi-Cal managed care plans will not be reflected in their rates for two years due to the rate setting process. There's always a lag of new costs being covered and included.,0.0
False,,We're also concerned about the additional and burdensome administrative reporting requirements by requiring health plans to track and monitor smoking rates with their enrollees at the time of enrollment in the plan.,0.0
False,,"Medi-Cal beneficiaries are allowed to change plans on a monthly basis, so the tracking and maintaining that information with a Smoking Cessation Program that doesn't require prior authorizations for medications will become very burdensome for our plans to manage and very expensive.

The Department's Budget Office worked throughout the year with each program to prepare expenditure projections and fund conditions.",0.0
False,,"The department and program monitored these projections closely, to manage and be aware of imbalances. When expenditures are projected to exceed revenues, this is watched very closely, but does not always indicate that a program is in need of a fee increase. The department works closely with each program that appears to have",0.0
False,,"potential Reserve shortages to mitigate the potential implications. When a program faces a potential fund issue, the department guides them through the available options.

False,,"So I don't anticipate the same level of rigidity. That was experienced in the recent year because we will not be in what, I'm going to talk in tech terms so let me apologize in advance, scope lock. We were in the middle of release two and we could not make any changes to the scope of that release until afterwards.",0.0

False,,"No, it would just be with the director. The current process is regulations that are being promulgated by the boards, I have a current approval process.",0.0
False,,"However, I do not have the authority to disapprove based on anti-competitive or if something is anti-competitive. So this is just adding that to the scope. It's a careful expansion of my state oversight.",0.0

False,,Your personal experience is actually spot on we do have a very very robust maintenance package or maintenance contract.,0.0

False,,It's just a way of mitigating the temporary problem.,0.0
False,,Absolutely,0.0
False,,"This is the issue and it is something that rightly so, we have to prove the need to the Legislature pursuant to last years conversations, we had to prove the need and the continued need for permanent staff ongoing. So I believe the need is being shown that we're going to need state staff.",0.0
False,,"And in order for the Department to provide increased services, not just what we're doing now, but I would like to provide better services to the boards and bureaus on BreEZe. It's an ongoing workload and I truly believe that there are some permanency associated with that.",0.0
False,,"We're always looking to see how best to spread the cost equitably. Senator, what we balance between is having drastic spikes and valleys in cost allocation and a stable cost distribution.",0.0
False,,"One of the current formulas, there's three or four formulas that I'm aware of. One of the current formulas, which is allocated positions. We feel it is the most equitable because it mitigates against the spikes and valleys that you would find as staff leaves, comes and if its based on workload.",0.0
False,,"There are cases to be made on basing costs on workload. But for the general services, the legal services, the core functions of DCA and the oversight that it provides.",0.0
False,,We try to keep the cost as stable as possible without having spikes and valleys.,0.0

False,,"So, we did a full assessment, and in that we made the arrangement to have a substantially less pro rata during that transition period.

False,,"There's many formulas, true use is one formula that's used to calculate pro-rata, two year forward is another. Allocated positions is another and not withstanding the fact that, as the Commissioner said, they do have their own hubs. They have a very seasoned legal staff, information technology staff etc.",0.0
False,,"The department requires staff to provide, that backbone of support and oversight. So they are very independent and do a lot of good work, but there are times and that we do provide oversight with that, that's where a certain formula that I spoke to earlier comes in, and there are still overall costs of providing that oversight.",0.0
False,,Right.,0.0
False,,"Well, to take the first question first, there are, we constantly look at ways of readjusting pro rata multiple times a year, etc. There are certain costs that cannot be diminished because it could detrimentally affect other clients within DCA. We do take into account, through certain formulas, what services are being subscribed for.",0.0
False,,"So all of those factors are being taken into account. The latter question, with regard to the services provided, as Mr. Beall stated, diminished services or inadequate services.

False,,"Look at the loan repayment, and schedule those when it's appropriate. So, I want to echo what he said. Very good, thank you. What's the interest rate? Frightening that I actually know this. I believe it is a little less than 1%.",0.0
False,,I could not agree more.,0.0
False,,"With regard to Senator, with regard to Mr Martin's bureau, as well as the previous bureau Commissioner Bell stated, there was through the transition, a persona to GRP two.

False,,Do you have a projected timeframe of when that will be completed and we can kind of put at least one behind us.,0.0
False,,"We wanted to decrease pro rata during that period of time as reflected in that sheet that you have. Now that the transition is over, the formula that is normally used to calculate pro rata based on size, usage, etc. There's many formulas that calculate pro rata. That is now being applied, which is why you're seeing that steep increase. That is alarming.",0.0
False,,"But I do want to assure this body that it is going from a artificial floor to what it normally should be based on many factors, size, usage, allocated positions, etc. So going back to what I said, the lower number was an artificial number to aid and transition pursuant to GRP 2.",0.0
False,,"The reason behind that is I would like to have more of state staff doing this and less vendor staff until I am able to hire and train state staff to do these fixes, minor or medium fixes, that's where we have to augment with the vendor staff.",0.0

We believe it sets a bad precedent in how California deals with grievances. It will load new administrative costs onto the health plans at a time when we really need to be conscious about affordability in the health insurance market.,0.0
False,,"And in our view it's designed to compel the coverage of more costlier drugs when more cost efficient drugs are ont he market. So just by way of background, California for several years has had a system in place to deal with grievances, Enrollees have access to an independent medical review or IMR administered by the state and is funded by the health plans. Where if there is a dispute over the medical necessity of a covered service, there can be an alternate or independent review of that dispute.",0.0
False,,"Before an enrollee, according to the law, can have access to this IMR process, the enrollee must first file a grievance with the plan to see if that agreement can be resolved before moving to the independent medical review system that's run by the state.

False,,"Whether it's a transplant, cardiac arrest treatment, or any other covered service, including any non-formulary prescription drugs.

False,,"Particularly when you consider drugs that may have serious or harmful side effects for the patient. Or where there are concerns for over addiction of drug abuse. Or if there's a generic on the market that's available that will do the job for much less. It's the health plan's job, of course, always to make sure that we're investing premium dollars in good care.",0.0
False,,"This bill is asking us to treat covered prescription drugs differently from every other service. And to obtain a result for the enrollee within a very tight 24-hour time frame under emergency circumstances. We believe that this is an overly aggressive time frame and we lead to one of two bad results in our view. One, the plan medical directors that are reviewing the case, may be compelled to just cover the requested drug, even if it's inappropriate for that particular person.",0.0
False,,"Or even if it's a widely expensive compare to other alternatives that are on the formulary. Number two, the likelier result is that the plan will just deny more requests due to the lack of time and information.

False,,Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association Health Plans in opposition to AB 2400. Because it goes beyond already confusing federal regulations. We believe it sets a bad precedent in how California deals with grievances. It will load new administrative costs onto the health plans at a time when we really need to be conscious about affordability in the health insurance market.,0.0
False,,"And in our view it's designed to compel the coverage of more costlier drugs when more cost efficient drugs are ont he market. So just by way of background, California for several years has had a system in place to deal with grievances, Enrollees have access to an independent medical review or IMR administered by the state and is funded by the health plans. Where if there is a dispute over the medical necessity of a covered service, there can be an alternate or independent review of that dispute.",0.0
False,,"Before an enrollee, according to the law, can have access to this IMR process, the enrollee must first file a grievance with the plan to see if that agreement can be resolved before moving to the independent medical review system that's run by the state. That system and the turn around times associated with this grievance process are the same for any covered service.",0.0
False,,"Whether it's a transplant, cardiac arrest treatment, or any other covered service, including any non-formulary prescription drugs. If the grievance is filed as an expedited review, the plan has only three days to respond to that. That is the current time line. We believe that is an absolutely reasonable time line.",0.0
False,,"Particularly when you consider drugs that may have serious or harmful side effects for the patient. Or where there are concerns for over addiction of drug abuse. Or if there's a generic on the market that's available that will do the job for much less. It's the health plan's job, of course, always to make sure that we're investing premium dollars in good care.",0.0
False,,"This bill is asking us to treat covered prescription drugs differently from every other service. And to obtain a result for the enrollee within a very tight 24-hour time frame under emergency circumstances. We believe that this is an overly aggressive time frame and we lead to one of two bad results in our view. One, the plan medical directors that are reviewing the case, may be compelled to just cover the requested drug, even if it's inappropriate for that particular person.",0.0
False,,"Or even if it's a widely expensive compare to other alternatives that are on the formulary. Number two, the likelier result is that the plan will just deny more requests due to the lack of time and information. And then send more and more requests to the independent medical review system that's run by the state. And that would be an unfortunate outcome from our perspective since many grievances can be resolved between a health plan and",0.0
False,,"the enrollee without going to independent medical review. According to the Department of Managed Health Care in its 2013 independent medical review summary report, about 23% of cases that qualified for an IMR were resolved without the independent medical review. Those were resolved through the internal plan grievance process between the enrollee and the health plan.",0.0
False,,"So from our perspective, the IMR process should really be reserved for actual disputes and not issues that could have been resolved beforehand. If adequate time was given for the health plan to reconsider its initial denial Or modification of the service. Just one last point, Mr. Chair.",0.0
False,,"The IMR process is actually very expensive. One of my plans tells me that an expedited request costs $3,000 per case. Non-expedited requests is about $1,500. And to the extent that this bill results in more and more cases going to IMR, it's going to increase administrative costs for",0.0

False,,"Well, thank you, Mr. Chair.",0.0
False,,"Actually, if I had time I may have pushed back on that part a little bit more as well. With respect to the non-formulary drugs aspect of it, the federal regulations that have been issued on that subject are very recent. And actually, we have a lot of questions about how that process is going to work.",0.0
False,,We still have some outstanding questions that we're working with the department to manage health care on about. How that federal process is going to fit in with the existing internal grievance processes the plans have. What the federal regulations did is they established a third party review of non-formulary drug cases. Which we just have a lot of concerns with in our work in the department on.,0.0
False,,So we do have concerns with that area. We're not sure that the bill's approach is the right approach on that. And we're still just trying to figure it out with CMS and with the Department of Managed Healthcare.,0.0
False,,"Mm-hm, so the 30 day wait time or turnaround time is actually for non emergent or nonemergency related issues. Again the emergency timeline is 3 days. Many of my clients said that often times cases are resolved within the 30 days or before the 30 days hit.",0.0

What is DMV's answer to, and is there a representative from DMV here to give an explanation to us about why that study has taken so long?",0.0
False,,"Just to follow up. So the issue of deterrence is not really the essence of the problem, which is that you don't want people to get behind a wheel with any amount of alcohol if they've had a previous conviction. In order to, it's not about getting caught the second time.",0.0
False,,"It's just preventing it from happening, period. And so the interlock device actually stops them at whatever level. It's not about whether they get caught another time, isn't that right? I mean, so is the study just off in terms of the essence of what you're trying to accomplish here with your bill?",0.0
False,,"And on hard suspensions. I don't really think there are hard suspensions. Because hard suspensions, the court usually, always grants a reasonable request to go to and from work. Or- But in terms of how it plays out in terms of what the court does. The court lets people drive only to and from work.",0.0

False,,"We're there, the DA's there, the defense attorney's there and we talk to the judge about it.

I did see in the documents that I got over the last couple days that we're celebrating the 100th birthday of the minimum wage established in 1916 here in California.,0.0
False,,"And when you look at the history of the wage over time, there's a couple things that are worth noting. Number one that it experienced a lot of these sudden spikes over the course of those hundred years. That there were periods of big rapid increases followed by not a lot going on. You can go back and look at periods of time that you think might match today or",0.0
False,,"might not match today in terms of what we are facing and where our economy is. You can go back to 1996 to 2002, we raised the minimum wage 58% in those six years from '96 to 2002. Very similar to what's being proposed in this legislation today.",0.0
False,,"During the inflationary times of the late 70s and early 80s, we raised the minimum wage 67% in three years. In the early 70s we raised it 51% in 2.5 years. I would note that two of those raises were done under the signature of Governor Reagan,",0.0
False,,both the 1968 minimum wage was raised and he signed legislation providing a almost a 27% increase in the minimum wage. And in 1974 the Legislature passed and Governor Reagan signed a 21% of increase in the minimum wage.,0.0
False,,"And certainly you can even go back and look at the period during the war, at World War II and right after. The Legislature raised the minimum wage 97% in 4.5 years.

False,,"It's not a healthy thing that allows folks to plan and make choices and adjustments. Yet when we go back and look over these hundred years, we see that issue of spikes, and it's an uncomfortable one. In the hundred years of the minimum wage, we've raised it 27 times.",0.0
False,,"And a lot of it has been in these areas, these years of spikes where the pressure is off and the pressure builds up and the Legislature and the Governor acts. The second area that I looked at carefully is this issue of coalesce, where you have no choice, that it's always going to go up.",0.0
False,,"And so what I tried to do was to look back over the last 40 years and say, if we had the bill that's before us today, in effect, where would the minimum wage be today? Where would it be? What would be facing the minimum wage out of control that would create great distress and harm to our economy or not?",0.0
False,,"And what I found was that, if you go back 40 years and I know conditions change, so I tried to take a wide span of time Of the minimum wage today. And let me make this caveat that the proposal before us is not an index without caps, the proposal before us is an index with a cap, a 3.5% cap. So I applied those criteria to that view of where would our minimum wage be today.",0.0
False,,"And if we go back 40 years, the minimum wage today, not $10 where it currently sits would be $5.68 under the bill that's before us right now with the 3.5% cap.

False,,"Would be $6.80 and even if you went back 10 years that the minimum wage under this legislation would be $8.3, well below what we currently have as our minimum wage. So for me at least on one hand you have this issue of spikes.",0.0
False,,"Yes, we move in the minimum wage up in a large amount over a period of years. On the other hand, it's balanced by a proposal that has an index with a cap that provides a much more conservative level of, certainly if you look back historically at what that wage may be. And so we need to apply that look in the crystal ball going out 40 years,.",0.0
False,,"Again, with an economy that we know will shift and change as it has over the last 40 years. You have the negative side of the quick increase at least of six years, not that quick, balanced with a cap. That's going to allow for a much gradual and more predictable change",0.0
False,,"over the next not 6 years, but 10, 20, 30, 40 year time horizons, that will get us to a place of much more balance and predictable situations. So when I looked at the original bill that came before us last year and what's before us today, I do see this very significant differences.",0.0
False,,"It does do what we have done over a 100 years which is the pressure builds up. And then we act with a much more substantial increase bounced out with this indexing with the cap. Finally, I want to make a couple of additional points, some of which have been made by members earlier.",0.0
False,,"The proposal for the increase of the minimum wage has nothing to do with any kind of government give away. It's only earned by someone working very, very hard in difficult jobs, repetitive jobs. Whether it is picking the crops in the field or serving us in restaurants, taking care of the elderly and the disabled,",0.0

False,,"We know there's consequences for business. But the cost of this is going to be borne by everybody, at every level of income. Whether they're the poorest or the wealthiest. In fact, it's easy to understand why those in the lower economics spectrum are actually going to pay more for the actions that we're going to take today, than those in the top. And I'll tell you, people talk a lot about global warming as being the issue of our time.",0.0
False,,"I actually think the issue is income inequality. That when you drill down to what creates destabilization within society and within democracies, it is the gap between the haves and the have nots. It's destabilizing and it's dangerous, and it does require our careful attention.",0.0
False,,"And it does require thoughtful action, which I believe is reflected in the bill that's before us. No bill is perfect. There are issues and concerns raised today, and I know we all have about its impact on business. It's impact on employment.

For many it was a day too long in coming I know and many it was a day that maybe it's come a little bit too fast, can always use more time. I voted against this, I declined to support this bill when it came before us last year.",0.0
False,,"And I want to talk about the reasons for that, and why today might be a different day. There's no doubt about the positives that come out of the legislation that's before us lifting millions out of poverty.",0.0
False,,"What an incredible opportunity to help so many. But the big challenges in this issue of minimum wage for me, at least have focused around the issue of the spikes, the rapid rise and cost and obligations to business. As well as the issue of the COLA, and indexing,",0.0
False,,that gives the appearance of an out of control cost increase that no one can really make choices about. And I want to talk about both of them. I did see in the documents that I got over the last couple days that we're celebrating the 100th birthday of the minimum wage established in 1916 here in California.,0.0
False,,"And when you look at the history of the wage over time, there's a couple things that are worth noting. Number one that it experienced a lot of these sudden spikes over the course of those hundred years. That there were periods of big rapid increases followed by not a lot going on. You can go back and look at periods of time that you think might match today or",0.0
False,,"might not match today in terms of what we are facing and where our economy is. You can go back to 1996 to 2002, we raised the minimum wage 58% in those six years from '96 to 2002. Very similar to what's being proposed in this legislation today.",0.0
False,,"During the inflationary times of the late 70s and early 80s, we raised the minimum wage 67% in three years. In the early 70s we raised it 51% in 2.5 years. I would note that two of those raises were done under the signature of Governor Reagan,",0.0
False,,both the 1968 minimum wage was raised and he signed legislation providing a almost a 27% increase in the minimum wage. And in 1974 the Legislature passed and Governor Reagan signed a 21% of increase in the minimum wage.,0.0
False,,"And certainly you can even go back and look at the period during the war, at World War II and right after. The Legislature raised the minimum wage 97% in 4.5 years. So this issue of spikes is a real issue, I think on no matter what side of the debate you're on, you'll say this is not a healthy thing for business.",0.0
False,,"It's not a healthy thing that allows folks to plan and make choices and adjustments. Yet when we go back and look over these hundred years, we see that issue of spikes, and it's an uncomfortable one. In the hundred years of the minimum wage, we've raised it 27 times.",0.0
False,,"And a lot of it has been in these areas, these years of spikes where the pressure is off and the pressure builds up and the Legislature and the Governor acts. The second area that I looked at carefully is this issue of coalesce, where you have no choice, that it's always going to go up.",0.0
False,,"And so what I tried to do was to look back over the last 40 years and say, if we had the bill that's before us today, in effect, where would the minimum wage be today? Where would it be? What would be facing the minimum wage out of control that would create great distress and harm to our economy or not?",0.0
False,,"And what I found was that, if you go back 40 years and I know conditions change, so I tried to take a wide span of time Of the minimum wage today. And let me make this caveat that the proposal before us is not an index without caps, the proposal before us is an index with a cap, a 3.5% cap. So I applied those criteria to that view of where would our minimum wage be today.",0.0
False,,"And if we go back 40 years, the minimum wage today, not $10 where it currently sits would be $5.68 under the bill that's before us right now with the 3.5% cap. If you go back and you'll look at it, let's say 30 years from today under the conditions of this bill with the minimum wage be?",0.0
False,,"Would be $6.80 and even if you went back 10 years that the minimum wage under this legislation would be $8.3, well below what we currently have as our minimum wage. So for me at least on one hand you have this issue of spikes.",0.0
False,,"Yes, we move in the minimum wage up in a large amount over a period of years. On the other hand, it's balanced by a proposal that has an index with a cap that provides a much more conservative level of, certainly if you look back historically at what that wage may be. And so we need to apply that look in the crystal ball going out 40 years,.",0.0
False,,"Again, with an economy that we know will shift and change as it has over the last 40 years. You have the negative side of the quick increase at least of six years, not that quick, balanced with a cap. That's going to allow for a much gradual and more predictable change",0.0
False,,"over the next not 6 years, but 10, 20, 30, 40 year time horizons, that will get us to a place of much more balance and predictable situations. So when I looked at the original bill that came before us last year and what's before us today, I do see this very significant differences.",0.0
False,,"It does do what we have done over a 100 years which is the pressure builds up. And then we act with a much more substantial increase bounced out with this indexing with the cap. Finally, I want to make a couple of additional points, some of which have been made by members earlier.",0.0
False,,"The proposal for the increase of the minimum wage has nothing to do with any kind of government give away. It's only earned by someone working very, very hard in difficult jobs, repetitive jobs. Whether it is picking the crops in the field or serving us in restaurants, taking care of the elderly and the disabled,",0.0
False,,"providing maintenance around our homes and around our shops. It's actually going to help reduce government subsidy for many people by bringing so many out of poverty. And finally, the issue of who's paying for this.",0.0
False,,"We know there's consequences for business. But the cost of this is going to be borne by everybody, at every level of income. Whether they're the poorest or the wealthiest. In fact, it's easy to understand why those in the lower economics spectrum are actually going to pay more for the actions that we're going to take today, than those in the top. And I'll tell you, people talk a lot about global warming as being the issue of our time.",0.0
False,,"I actually think the issue is income inequality. That when you drill down to what creates destabilization within society and within democracies, it is the gap between the haves and the have nots. It's destabilizing and it's dangerous, and it does require our careful attention.",0.0
False,,"And it does require thoughtful action, which I believe is reflected in the bill that's before us. No bill is perfect. There are issues and concerns raised today, and I know we all have about its impact on business. It's impact on employment. It is going to require us to carefully watch what happens and to be in a position to correct problems as they are raised.",0.0
False,,"But on balance, this is a measure that in the 100th year birthday of the minimum wage. I think is a positive and productive step forward, that will create a consistency, a predictability that will enable both our businesses and workers to prosper here in the Golden State.

False,,"And number one, the new notice under SB 908 fails to include a critical feature of federal regulations, which allows a health plan to explain its rationale of moving forward with the rate.

False,,"Good morning Mr. Chairman, members. Lauren DeValencia again representing the American Planning Association. And we do appreciate the author's' efforts to look at different and more creative ways of finding housing, but we must respectfully oppose this approach. The requirement to assess the potential addition of housing on top of an existing public facility simply isn't viable. In order to add additional floors to existing operating public facilities, it must be built with the knowledge or the potential of adding that additional housing so that the structure meets code requirements to carry the weight and height of that added housing development. Other than single family homes, our planners haven't seen any significant additions to floors to existing buildings and don't believe that it would be easy to do so. And we don't object to the bill's requirement that the inventory of sites include a review of underutilized sites to determine if they are viable for a housing development.",0.0
False,,"However, we just want to note that it may not result in additional housing depending on when the current site is available and when it might be, excuse me, when it might be available for development.

False,,"Thank you, Madame Chair, and members. I appreciate the opportunity to be here to talk about my top bill of the year. I call it the California Promise. There is a lot that we have to be proud of in terms of our higher education system here in California, from the 2 million plus kids who go to the community colleges to the 450,000 of the CSU and the many that attend the University of California.",0.0
False,,"We take great pride in the quality of the education that's provided and the affordability and in the accessibility. In fact, if you look around the country, these are high watermarks for higher education. that bring a claim to our leaders that run these institutions, the faculty that serve and provide such great quality education to our kids.",0.0
False,,"But there is a place within our higher education system that is not so good and that's in the area of student success. If you look at the four year graduation rate in California at our state Universities, it's near the bottom in the nation. And next to me here is a chart that shows our four year graduation rates at the various campuses within the California State University.",0.0
False,,"You'll see that if you sent your student to Sacramento State this year the likelihood that they would graduate in four years is about 8%. And as a system, as a whole the four year graduation rate is about 18.6%. That's about 25% below the national average for comparable public institutions that we have here in the California State Universities.",0.0
False,,"I've had a lot of opportunity to study this problem, both as a student at San Diego State in my youth, whereas a student leader I attended four years of trustee meetings just prior to being elected to the Senate. In fact, I had to resign my trusteeship with the California State Universities when I was sworn in to the Senate. I'd served there for four years.",0.0
False,,"And it's an issue of great concern, this area of student success. And I know that we have wonderful campus presidents, and faculty, and system wide leaders, and trustees, that spend a lot of time trying to figure this problem out.",0.0
False,,"But a lot of the problem solving that goes into the issue focuses in on the 6 year graduation rate, as if we've just given up on the idea that students who want to get out in four years can do so. A recent UCLA study was done of incoming freshman, and asked them whether they wanted to get through in four years, about 85% said that was their goal when they began at the University.",0.0
False,,"So I have legislation that I think can breakthrough this problem and provide an opportunity for many more kids to get through in four years. I call it the California promise. And the goal of course is to increase the four year graduation rate. By doing so, we lower the cost and that obligations to students. We expand the number degrees that can meet the needs of California employers.",0.0
False,,"We reduce our overall state costs, and we can prepare our community college students for an on-time graduation right when they begin. And the elements of the California promise are fairly simple, and they are as follows. It provides and optional, and I underscore the word optional, contract between the student and the University which as obligations on both sides.",0.0
False,,"On the student's side, it would require that they maintain a minimum unit load of about 30 academic units in an academic year and they maintain a minimum GPA standard. And on the University side, they would provide enhanced academic advising, priority registration, a freeze on tuition so whatever the tuition was when they entered University, if they maintain the requirements of the contract, it would stay the same through all four years.",0.0
False,,"And finally, if through no fault of their own, they were required to take a class for their degree achievement, and it was not available to them, in four years, the University would provide to them at no cost after that four year period had expired. I project that this program if implemented would provide an additional 14,000 students with degrees on time in four years.",0.0
False,,"I would free up seats for incoming students. For those students who were able to graduate in four years instead of five, the estimate by the Campaign for College Opportunity would save those students and their family's $220 million. We would add graduates to our workforce, paying more taxes, certainly earning a salary for the first time in their lives, which would help them and of course our economy.",0.0
False,,"We've had in California, in the state universities, some pilot programs that mirror many of the elements of the California Promise. And two of the most acclaimed programs are at Cal Poly Pomona, and Cal Poly San Bernardino. And those programs, some of which began as early as 2007.",0.0
False,,"And it what we found in those programs is the kids that went through that four year pledge program graduated at twice the regular student graduation rate at the University. So at Pomona, the kids that are in that program are graduating at 40% in four years. 40%, double the school average of little under 20.",0.0
False,,"And at San Bernardino, they're graduating around 23%, also doubling the number of the rate when the program began in 2007. So there's some real signs of a positive path here. I want to underscore that this legislation sets a goal which we've never had before, which was to meet and exceed the national graduation rate. It's about a 25% improvement.",0.0
False,,"So it sets a state wide standard, it lays out the broad parameters of the program as I've described, but it leaves it to the state university system leadership and the community college leadership to undertake it in a way that serves their unique campuses and their unique systems.",0.0
False,,"Finally I want to point out that one of the challenges that we face, and I know you talk about quite a bit, is the achievement gap for students that are K through 12, at our University system. It's important to note that in the Pomona and the San Bernardino programs that the students that were able to be successful in those programs reflected the great diversity of those campuses.",0.0
False,,"At San Bernardino 58% of the participants from Pell Grant recipients, and 83% were traditionally underrepresented students. And at Pomona 70% of the kids in that program are traditionally underrepresented students. So, while this program in and of itself can't close the achievement gap, what we are seeing is that, that desire to get out in four years is attracting the interest of all students of the great diversity that are currently going to our University system.",0.0
False,,"Finally, I've had a great opportunity to visit with the Chair and the Committee staff to talk about this legislation. I certainly appreciate all their constructive input and suggestions we Certainly share the same goals. And I want to respond to the Committee analysis. I think we've worked a number of the issues.",0.0
False,,"The Committee analysis suggests that we delete the community colleges as recommended on page five. But with the Chair's agreement, I'd like to instead amend the bill to define a quote qualifying student with a California Promise program at our community colleges to be the 1440 associate degree for transfer students who utilizes these student's success act services to complete community colleges within two years.",0.0
False,,"So in essence, we're going to build on the good work of this Committee of the Chair, and of the community colleges, in creating the Student Success Act program. We have, of course, the associate degree for transfer program that's recently implemented, so we're going to build on top of those tracks within the California Promise program.",0.0
False,,"So, one of the things that been very important to me is that we not discriminate against students who want to start at the community colleges in terms of getting through in four years, and that means to provide the same benefits that one would get starting at the state universities as they would now get at the community colleges. So within the Student Success Act, we have priority registration, we have enhanced academic advising.",0.0
False,,"I'd like the opportunity to give that same tuition freeze to community college student's as they would be for CSU. And this amendment I think, will satisfy some of the concerns that have been raised about weaving these programs successfully together.",0.0
False,,"And then finally, upon completing an associate degree at the community colleges, a California Promise student would be guaranteed a slot in the California State Universities under the California Promise program. And their tuition would be set at an amount as if they had started at the state universities rather than at the community colleges, in addition to all the benefits that I've further mentioned. Finally, with the chair's approval I'd like to continue to work on the tuition aspect of the bill and the Appropriations Committee. And with that I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"To the Chair, so if the student has said they want to work under the provisions of the California Promise and something comes up in their life that means they can't meet the requirements. They can remove themselves from the program without any penalty. They'll be back in the student body as a whole with the same priority registration that would normally be alloted to them based on their standing in the University.",0.0
False,,"So through the Chair, I'm going to leave that the implementation of the registration priority to the systems and the campuses themselves to make those difficult choices that are there every day today for students, in terms of whether they're able to get that class or they're able to get that pre-requisite. A part of what we're pushing for in this legislation is to get the system to operate more efficiently and have more kids succeed than are succeeding today.",0.0
False,,"That's the foundational elements of why I'm here and why I'm advancing this idea and this legislation. It's because the status quo isn't working, and that most kids are not able to get through. In fact, if you take this, we talk about the four-year graduation rate at the state universities is a little under 19%.",0.0
False,,"You know, the six-year graduation rate is about 57%. And even at those levels, we have 40%. We have not just thousands of students failing, and not even 10 thousands, we have hundreds of thousands of kids that have failed. Our system has failed for them.",0.0
False,,"They have the debt, they have the time commitment, and they have nothing, very little for it. Now, there's some who are engaged in our university system because of the wonderful elements of a higher learning and understanding the world that we live, and so, I don't speak to that great benefit that they would get.",0.0
False,,"But for the vast majority that are trying to achieve a degree and get through in a reasonable amount of time, certainly a sign that maybe they can't afford to spend doing it. The system is failing today. Think about it. It's an 80% failure rate for a four-year degree. And it's an uncomfortable truth that I think that for many here that I've met with, I think there's a lot of surprise.",0.0
False,,"Certainly not for parents and not for kids who are going through it and having trouble, but for many around here, it is a surprise to see the rate being so low, because no one wants to talk about it. But the rates are, it's a pretty big failure. And that failure results, those are numbers of kids who couldn't get their classes, and who couldn't get through. That's what it is. So, I'm trying to be directed to your question. Is some student going to be disadvantaged? We certainly would like to avoid that entirely.",0.0
False,,"Through the Chair. I give the flexibility to the system to, they could take, say an engineering degree that maybe a five-year degree, they could, nothing in my legislation would limit their ability to create that five-year program with that five-year certainty to someone in an engineering degree. 95% of the degree programs at the state universities require 120 units.",0.0
False,,"But yes, there are some that require more. Nothing in this would prevent them from coming up with a program that is applicable to those students in those disciplines. And finally, may I answer one additional point that you make. because a part of the narrative from the state University, and it's one I've always embraced is that we do serve a lot of diverse students that come to us from different walks of life and different challenges in life.",0.0
False,,"They aren't always the ones that can leap to the University of California, take that full load and achieve, right? But there's some interesting things that I discovered as I dug deeper into the facts on that, and I brought a chart to illustrate it.",0.0
False,,"And what this is, is we took all the students that attended the California State University last year, this past fall, which is over 450,000, and we broke down the number of units that they took this fall to try to understand how many kids do we have that can't take that full load because that's what we were always talking about.",0.0
False,,"That's why we talked about the six-year degree as the standard, not the four-year. And here's what we found, that only 13% of the kids enrolling in the fall were taking less than 12 units. Okay? That 87% were trying to get through. They had the capacity to balance the challenges that they were facing.",0.0
False,,"They want to get through as fast as they can. So we see that more than 50% took between 12 and 14 units, and 34% took 15 units or more. And so, they have the capacity, more than we even know, to try to get through. But we have the limitations that we're facing.",0.0
False,,"Now to the ability not to get the classes that they need. Maybe they needed some academic advising help. Here's another interesting factoid. If you take all the kids that didn't graduate this past year from the state universities, as I mentioned, most degree programs are 120 units, that if you wanted to stay on track, that's what you would end up with, the average unit count of a student who graduated last year from the state universities was 135 units.",0.0
False,,"It took an entire extra semester more of time and cost that weren't applicable to a specific degree program. Now, are some kids changing their majors? Yes, no problem. And my legislation will not create any limitation to someone changing their major, running into an issue where they need to take a semester off.",0.0
False,,"It's not going to set them back any different than it sets them back today. But we have a very motivated student body who want to get through and wants to get that degree, and yet, there are road blocks that get in the way. And that's what we're trying to break down in this legislation, where we can serve more students and have more of them achieve than what's happening today.",0.0
False,,"Through the Chair. Those are big questions we face everyday, Senator. Can we adequately fund our University system? Can it provide the access to the many kids whose parents have paid taxes all these years and now want to enter them? And so, it remains a perpetual challenge for all of us.",0.0
False,,"If you would like to put money into my bill to hire more faculty, I think I certainly would be supportive of that. And that's a challenge that we face in general terms of the budget process. If you look at the two pilot programs at Pomona and San Bernardino, what did they do to get that level of success?",0.0
False,,"And this past year in Pomona, they've admitted over 900 kids, so it's not small, 900 kids into their four-year pledge program. They retain one additional counselor, one additional academic advisor. And the costs of the program at that campus was, they estimate it to be about $75,000.",0.0
False,,"So, I don't mean to downplay the heartfelt concern you have about having enough faculty, getting our institutions to be more robustly funded so tuition cannot go up, and we can have the support services and enough faculty to teach all the courses. That remains a long term goal that we all have.",0.0
False,,"I'm trying to for the most part take our existing resources that we're providing, and finding a pathway to using them more efficiently. If we get kids through this faster, everybody saves. The institution, it means they don't have kids in a class that they can offer to somebody else, right?",0.0
False,,"That frees up a seat. That means that they can admit more kids. They can save money to use for other purposes or other enhancements on the campuses. So, at the heart of this is creating an efficiency within our system. I wish it could be providing a lot more money and I certainly would like to work more with you on that.",0.0
False,,"And may I ask through the chair, are you suggesting that we eliminate the tuition freeze, Senator?",0.0
False,,"May I respond, Madam Chair?",0.0
False,,"Okay. The second thing is that there is a working draft that the CSU is going to consider within the coming year about creating a gradual tuition increase over time to stop the spikes and then the depressed times and the spikes that have been happening over the years on tuition. And one of the recommendations that's there is to set it at 2%, a 2% increase a year.",0.0
False,,"If that were to happen under my legislation, it would benefit a student about $55 a semester. $55, it would be about $110 a year. So the benefit to the student over the course of the four years, if tuition was increased 2% every year, and again, it's been flat for the last five, but let's just take that as a scenario, it would save the student and their family about $500.",0.0
False,,"The tuition freeze is not meant as financial aid, it's meant as a small incentive that provides a very modest gain but provides, from a family perspective, some level of certainty that makes this program very, very attractive. Okay, so, I guess my argument back would be that I pledge to the chair to try to work out the issue of the tuition and how that gets reconciled. I don't want to discriminate against a student going to the community college here in Sacramento.",0.0
False,,"If they want to start at the community college because they can't get into Sac State, or that they're hoping to get in, I want them to be able to go to that community college without feeling like they've been discriminated against because they weren't able to start at the California State Universities, so that they could pay the same as a California State University student.",0.0
False,,"And finally, I don't know if you're aware, but that, the tuition policy for the state universities today is about 30% higher than it needs to be. And it's done that way, because they provide that extra 30% as financial aid for about a third of those who enter the state universities.",0.0
False,,"So by policy today, choices are being made about what's the right balance for those who need the help, those who can maybe pay more, and it's a constant struggle. There's no right answer to it. These choices are made when UC charges 12, why? Why do we only charge 5500, why is the fee at community college less?",0.0
False,,"So these are difficult choices that we all need to make, they're not easy. But the tuition freeze, for me, is an attractive element because it's small, but it's a wonderful incentive to stay under contract and get through in four years because the benefit financially, is not just to the student, it's certainly not about the $500 in the four years, it's that we're going to free up seats. So the institution's going to either gain financially or allow us to enroll a lot many more kids.",0.0
False,,Thank you very much.,0.0
False,,"Madame Chair and Senators Seth Bramble here on behalf of the California Teachers Association respectfully opposed to Senate bill 1224. The Senator spoke of a tax. And I got here in 2009, since then every year it seems like there's been a new attack on the teachers seniority system in new and creative ways. CTA places a high value on seniority.",0.0
False,,"More experienced teachers are able to produce better results in the classroom than inexperienced teachers. It's a fact that's pointed out by research. But when we're talking about assignments and reassignments, what are we talking about here? We're talking about when, for example, there are too many teachers at a grade level.",0.0
False,,"Or too many teachers at a school site. What the center's proposing here in reporting that data to the California Department of Education when it occurs based on seniority is simply impractical as the analysis points out there is a number of factors that go into that. So, across the state if you have let's say for example, too many teachers at third grade, not enough at first grade.",0.0
False,,"Usually what the principal would do first is say do we have any volunteers? Does anybody want to go down to first grade? If they don't get a volunteer, they consider a number of factors and seniority is one of those factors. It's also as the analysis points out have they taught anything close to first grade before?",0.0
False,,"Do they have special training? Do they have special credentialing? And in fact, we negotiate language around this area that generally has some pretty wishy-washy language in it, something that says something along the lines of some of the factors that the administrator will consider aside from credentialing and",0.0
False,,"all that other stuff is factors thought to be in the best interest for the operation of the school, something like that. The bottom line is that the administrator is given totally authority to move teachers as they want. And occasionally there will be a grievance that's filed based on that contract language. Generally what that comes from is we've seen some situations where a new principal to a school site feels",0.0
False,,"a little intimidated by the fact that there's a 20 year teacher there who has strong connections into the community, knows all the parents, knows all the history of the school. And in an effort to push that teacher into retirement. In some cases we've seen teacher maybe who's taught kindergarten for 15 years, suddenly being told, you're going to be given a sixth grade assignment.",0.0
False,,"In those cases when that occurs, sometimes we'll file agreements and hopefully negotiate a resolution along the way. Because if it gets to the end of the process, if it gets to arbitration, we lose that case. The state recognizes that the administrators have control to move folks where they want within the school site. Or even out of the school site if there's too many.",0.0
False,,"So it doesn't make sense then if there's a number of factors being considered to have a district report to the state when seniority is the issue, seniority is one of five or six factors that are being considered. Initially volunteers is what occurs, but we abjure opposition. It doesn't make sense, it's impractical.",0.0

And next to me here is a chart that shows our four year graduation rates at the various campuses within the California State University.",0.0
False,,"You'll see that if you sent your student to Sacramento State this year the likelihood that they would graduate in four years is about 8%. And as a system, as a whole the four year graduation rate is about 18.6%. That's about 25% below the national average for comparable public institutions that we have here in the California State Universities.",0.0
False,,"I've had a lot of opportunity to study this problem, both as a student at San Diego State in my youth, whereas a student leader I attended four years of trustee meetings just prior to being elected to the Senate. In fact, I had to resign my trusteeship with the California State Universities when I was sworn in to the Senate. I'd served there for four years.",0.0
False,,"And it's an issue of great concern, this area of student success. And I know that we have wonderful campus presidents, and faculty, and system wide leaders, and trustees, that spend a lot of time trying to figure this problem out.",0.0
False,,"But a lot of the problem solving that goes into the issue focuses in on the 6 year graduation rate, as if we've just given up on the idea that students who want to get out in four years can do so. A recent UCLA study was done of incoming freshman, and asked them whether they wanted to get through in four years, about 85% said that was their goal when they began at the University.",0.0
False,,"So I have legislation that I think can breakthrough this problem and provide an opportunity for many more kids to get through in four years. I call it the California promise. And the goal of course is to increase the four year graduation rate. By doing so, we lower the cost and that obligations to students. We expand the number degrees that can meet the needs of California employers.",0.0
False,,"We reduce our overall state costs, and we can prepare our community college students for an on-time graduation right when they begin. And the elements of the California promise are fairly simple, and they are as follows. It provides and optional, and I underscore the word optional, contract between the student and the University which as obligations on both sides.",0.0
False,,"On the student's side, it would require that they maintain a minimum unit load of about 30 academic units in an academic year and they maintain a minimum GPA standard. And on the University side, they would provide enhanced academic advising, priority registration, a freeze on tuition so whatever the tuition was when they entered University, if they maintain the requirements of the contract, it would stay the same through all four years.",0.0
False,,"And finally, if through no fault of their own, they were required to take a class for their degree achievement, and it was not available to them, in four years, the University would provide to them at no cost after that four year period had expired. I project that this program if implemented would provide an additional 14,000 students with degrees on time in four years.",0.0
False,,"I would free up seats for incoming students. For those students who were able to graduate in four years instead of five, the estimate by the Campaign for College Opportunity would save those students and their family's $220 million. We would add graduates to our workforce, paying more taxes, certainly earning a salary for the first time in their lives, which would help them and of course our economy.",0.0
False,,"We've had in California, in the state universities, some pilot programs that mirror many of the elements of the California Promise. And two of the most acclaimed programs are at Cal Poly Pomona, and Cal Poly San Bernardino. And those programs, some of which began as early as 2007.",0.0
False,,"And it what we found in those programs is the kids that went through that four year pledge program graduated at twice the regular student graduation rate at the University. So at Pomona, the kids that are in that program are graduating at 40% in four years. 40%, double the school average of little under 20.",0.0
False,,"And at San Bernardino, they're graduating around 23%, also doubling the number of the rate when the program began in 2007. So there's some real signs of a positive path here. I want to underscore that this legislation sets a goal which we've never had before, which was to meet and exceed the national graduation rate. It's about a 25% improvement.",0.0
False,,"So it sets a state wide standard, it lays out the broad parameters of the program as I've described, but it leaves it to the state university system leadership and the community college leadership to undertake it in a way that serves their unique campuses and their unique systems.",0.0
False,,"Finally I want to point out that one of the challenges that we face, and I know you talk about quite a bit, is the achievement gap for students that are K through 12, at our University system. It's important to note that in the Pomona and the San Bernardino programs that the students that were able to be successful in those programs reflected the great diversity of those campuses.",0.0
False,,"At San Bernardino 58% of the participants from Pell Grant recipients, and 83% were traditionally underrepresented students. And at Pomona 70% of the kids in that program are traditionally underrepresented students. So, while this program in and of itself can't close the achievement gap, what we are seeing is that, that desire to get out in four years is attracting the interest of all students of the great diversity that are currently going to our University system.",0.0
False,,"Finally, I've had a great opportunity to visit with the Chair and the Committee staff to talk about this legislation. I certainly appreciate all their constructive input and suggestions we Certainly share the same goals. And I want to respond to the Committee analysis. I think we've worked a number of the issues.",0.0
False,,"The Committee analysis suggests that we delete the community colleges as recommended on page five. But with the Chair's agreement, I'd like to instead amend the bill to define a quote qualifying student with a California Promise program at our community colleges to be the 1440 associate degree for transfer students who utilizes these student's success act services to complete community colleges within two years.",0.0
False,,"So in essence, we're going to build on the good work of this Committee of the Chair, and of the community colleges, in creating the Student Success Act program. We have, of course, the associate degree for transfer program that's recently implemented, so we're going to build on top of those tracks within the California Promise program.",0.0
False,,"So, one of the things that been very important to me is that we not discriminate against students who want to start at the community colleges in terms of getting through in four years, and that means to provide the same benefits that one would get starting at the state universities as they would now get at the community colleges. So within the Student Success Act, we have priority registration, we have enhanced academic advising.",0.0
False,,"I'd like the opportunity to give that same tuition freeze to community college student's as they would be for CSU. And this amendment I think, will satisfy some of the concerns that have been raised about weaving these programs successfully together.",0.0
False,,"And then finally, upon completing an associate degree at the community colleges, a California Promise student would be guaranteed a slot in the California State Universities under the California Promise program. And their tuition would be set at an amount as if they had started at the state universities rather than at the community colleges, in addition to all the benefits that I've further mentioned. Finally, with the chair's approval I'd like to continue to work on the tuition aspect of the bill and the Appropriations Committee. And with that I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"To the Chair, so if the student has said they want to work under the provisions of the California Promise and something comes up in their life that means they can't meet the requirements. They can remove themselves from the program without any penalty. They'll be back in the student body as a whole with the same priority registration that would normally be alloted to them based on their standing in the University.",0.0
False,,"So through the Chair, I'm going to leave that the implementation of the registration priority to the systems and the campuses themselves to make those difficult choices that are there every day today for students, in terms of whether they're able to get that class or they're able to get that pre-requisite. A part of what we're pushing for in this legislation is to get the system to operate more efficiently and have more kids succeed than are succeeding today.",0.0
False,,"That's the foundational elements of why I'm here and why I'm advancing this idea and this legislation. It's because the status quo isn't working, and that most kids are not able to get through. In fact, if you take this, we talk about the four-year graduation rate at the state universities is a little under 19%.",0.0
False,,"You know, the six-year graduation rate is about 57%. And even at those levels, we have 40%. We have not just thousands of students failing, and not even 10 thousands, we have hundreds of thousands of kids that have failed. Our system has failed for them.",0.0
False,,"They have the debt, they have the time commitment, and they have nothing, very little for it. Now, there's some who are engaged in our university system because of the wonderful elements of a higher learning and understanding the world that we live, and so, I don't speak to that great benefit that they would get.",0.0
False,,"But for the vast majority that are trying to achieve a degree and get through in a reasonable amount of time, certainly a sign that maybe they can't afford to spend doing it. The system is failing today. Think about it. It's an 80% failure rate for a four-year degree. And it's an uncomfortable truth that I think that for many here that I've met with, I think there's a lot of surprise.",0.0
False,,"Certainly not for parents and not for kids who are going through it and having trouble, but for many around here, it is a surprise to see the rate being so low, because no one wants to talk about it. But the rates are, it's a pretty big failure. And that failure results, those are numbers of kids who couldn't get their classes, and who couldn't get through. That's what it is. So, I'm trying to be directed to your question. Is some student going to be disadvantaged? We certainly would like to avoid that entirely.",0.0
False,,"Through the Chair. I give the flexibility to the system to, they could take, say an engineering degree that maybe a five-year degree, they could, nothing in my legislation would limit their ability to create that five-year program with that five-year certainty to someone in an engineering degree. 95% of the degree programs at the state universities require 120 units.",0.0
False,,"But yes, there are some that require more. Nothing in this would prevent them from coming up with a program that is applicable to those students in those disciplines. And finally, may I answer one additional point that you make. because a part of the narrative from the state University, and it's one I've always embraced is that we do serve a lot of diverse students that come to us from different walks of life and different challenges in life.",0.0
False,,"They aren't always the ones that can leap to the University of California, take that full load and achieve, right? But there's some interesting things that I discovered as I dug deeper into the facts on that, and I brought a chart to illustrate it.",0.0
False,,"And what this is, is we took all the students that attended the California State University last year, this past fall, which is over 450,000, and we broke down the number of units that they took this fall to try to understand how many kids do we have that can't take that full load because that's what we were always talking about.",0.0
False,,"That's why we talked about the six-year degree as the standard, not the four-year. And here's what we found, that only 13% of the kids enrolling in the fall were taking less than 12 units. Okay? That 87% were trying to get through. They had the capacity to balance the challenges that they were facing.",0.0
False,,"They want to get through as fast as they can. So we see that more than 50% took between 12 and 14 units, and 34% took 15 units or more. And so, they have the capacity, more than we even know, to try to get through. But we have the limitations that we're facing.",0.0
False,,"Now to the ability not to get the classes that they need. Maybe they needed some academic advising help. Here's another interesting factoid. If you take all the kids that didn't graduate this past year from the state universities, as I mentioned, most degree programs are 120 units, that if you wanted to stay on track, that's what you would end up with, the average unit count of a student who graduated last year from the state universities was 135 units.",0.0
False,,"It took an entire extra semester more of time and cost that weren't applicable to a specific degree program. Now, are some kids changing their majors? Yes, no problem. And my legislation will not create any limitation to someone changing their major, running into an issue where they need to take a semester off.",0.0
False,,"It's not going to set them back any different than it sets them back today. But we have a very motivated student body who want to get through and wants to get that degree, and yet, there are road blocks that get in the way. And that's what we're trying to break down in this legislation, where we can serve more students and have more of them achieve than what's happening today.",0.0
False,,"Through the Chair. Those are big questions we face everyday, Senator. Can we adequately fund our University system? Can it provide the access to the many kids whose parents have paid taxes all these years and now want to enter them? And so, it remains a perpetual challenge for all of us.",0.0
False,,"If you would like to put money into my bill to hire more faculty, I think I certainly would be supportive of that. And that's a challenge that we face in general terms of the budget process. If you look at the two pilot programs at Pomona and San Bernardino, what did they do to get that level of success?",0.0
False,,"And this past year in Pomona, they've admitted over 900 kids, so it's not small, 900 kids into their four-year pledge program. They retain one additional counselor, one additional academic advisor. And the costs of the program at that campus was, they estimate it to be about $75,000.",0.0
False,,"So, I don't mean to downplay the heartfelt concern you have about having enough faculty, getting our institutions to be more robustly funded so tuition cannot go up, and we can have the support services and enough faculty to teach all the courses. That remains a long term goal that we all have.",0.0
False,,"I'm trying to for the most part take our existing resources that we're providing, and finding a pathway to using them more efficiently. If we get kids through this faster, everybody saves. The institution, it means they don't have kids in a class that they can offer to somebody else, right?",0.0
False,,"That frees up a seat. That means that they can admit more kids. They can save money to use for other purposes or other enhancements on the campuses. So, at the heart of this is creating an efficiency within our system. I wish it could be providing a lot more money and I certainly would like to work more with you on that.",0.0
False,,"And may I ask through the chair, are you suggesting that we eliminate the tuition freeze, Senator?",0.0
False,,"May I respond, Madam Chair?",0.0
False,,"Okay. The second thing is that there is a working draft that the CSU is going to consider within the coming year about creating a gradual tuition increase over time to stop the spikes and then the depressed times and the spikes that have been happening over the years on tuition. And one of the recommendations that's there is to set it at 2%, a 2% increase a year.",0.0
False,,"If that were to happen under my legislation, it would benefit a student about $55 a semester. $55, it would be about $110 a year. So the benefit to the student over the course of the four years, if tuition was increased 2% every year, and again, it's been flat for the last five, but let's just take that as a scenario, it would save the student and their family about $500.",0.0
False,,"The tuition freeze is not meant as financial aid, it's meant as a small incentive that provides a very modest gain but provides, from a family perspective, some level of certainty that makes this program very, very attractive. Okay, so, I guess my argument back would be that I pledge to the chair to try to work out the issue of the tuition and how that gets reconciled. I don't want to discriminate against a student going to the community college here in Sacramento.",0.0
False,,"If they want to start at the community college because they can't get into Sac State, or that they're hoping to get in, I want them to be able to go to that community college without feeling like they've been discriminated against because they weren't able to start at the California State Universities, so that they could pay the same as a California State University student.",0.0
False,,"And finally, I don't know if you're aware, but that, the tuition policy for the state universities today is about 30% higher than it needs to be. And it's done that way, because they provide that extra 30% as financial aid for about a third of those who enter the state universities.",0.0
False,,"So by policy today, choices are being made about what's the right balance for those who need the help, those who can maybe pay more, and it's a constant struggle. There's no right answer to it. These choices are made when UC charges 12, why? Why do we only charge 5500, why is the fee at community college less?",0.0
False,,"So these are difficult choices that we all need to make, they're not easy. But the tuition freeze, for me, is an attractive element because it's small, but it's a wonderful incentive to stay under contract and get through in four years because the benefit financially, is not just to the student, it's certainly not about the $500 in the four years, it's that we're going to free up seats. So the institution's going to either gain financially or allow us to enroll a lot many more kids.",0.0
False,,Thank you very much.,0.0
False,,I don't have any witnesses.,0.0
False,,"A couple things, Senator. First, I'm leaving it up to the board of trustees to set the tuition. It's not just the Legislature, it hasn't been the Legislature's prerogative to do that. So nothing in my bill sets the tuition. It simply says that if the state University wants to offer a contract, they should establish what that tuition should be. And if you want it to be higher, they may decide to make it higher, But it leaves that choice really up to them is the first thing.",0.0

Civil settlements aren't necessarily a symptom of faulty work, they're symptoms of an extraordinary litigious state, and very litigious in this area of the law. I asked our contractors which are all Union Engineering Contractors, so they are the dirt movers, the ones that do the initial grading.",0.0
False,,"All of them that have worked on any condominium jobs or attached housing have been sued. All of them have been sued and all of them have agreed to civil settlements. And many of them, until most recently, have chose not to work on these projects because they knew they would get sued.",0.0

But when we're talking about assignments and reassignments, what are we talking about here? We're talking about when, for example, there are too many teachers at a grade level.",0.0
False,,"Or too many teachers at a school site. What the center's proposing here in reporting that data to the California Department of Education when it occurs based on seniority is simply impractical as the analysis points out there is a number of factors that go into that. So, across the state if you have let's say for example, too many teachers at third grade, not enough at first grade.",0.0
False,,"Usually what the principal would do first is say do we have any volunteers? Does anybody want to go down to first grade? If they don't get a volunteer, they consider a number of factors and seniority is one of those factors. It's also as the analysis points out have they taught anything close to first grade before?",0.0
False,,"Do they have special training? Do they have special credentialing? And in fact, we negotiate language around this area that generally has some pretty wishy-washy language in it, something that says something along the lines of some of the factors that the administrator will consider aside from credentialing and",0.0
False,,"all that other stuff is factors thought to be in the best interest for the operation of the school, something like that. The bottom line is that the administrator is given totally authority to move teachers as they want. And occasionally there will be a grievance that's filed based on that contract language. Generally what that comes from is we've seen some situations where a new principal to a school site feels",0.0
False,,"a little intimidated by the fact that there's a 20 year teacher there who has strong connections into the community, knows all the parents, knows all the history of the school. And in an effort to push that teacher into retirement. In some cases we've seen teacher maybe who's taught kindergarten for 15 years, suddenly being told, you're going to be given a sixth grade assignment.",0.0
False,,"In those cases when that occurs, sometimes we'll file agreements and hopefully negotiate a resolution along the way. Because if it gets to the end of the process, if it gets to arbitration, we lose that case. The state recognizes that the administrators have control to move folks where they want within the school site. Or even out of the school site if there's too many.",0.0
False,,"So it doesn't make sense then if there's a number of factors being considered to have a district report to the state when seniority is the issue, seniority is one of five or six factors that are being considered. Initially volunteers is what occurs, but we abjure opposition. It doesn't make sense, it's impractical.",0.0

False,,"Good morning, Dan Caplan with the LAO. You should all be receiving a copy of a handout entitled Teacher Workforce Trends. I believe it's being passed out right now, but to provide a brief overview of what I'll be covering in the interim, I'll be discussing some recent trends in the labor market for teachers, evidence of shortage or shortage areas, a summary of prior policy responses attempted at the federal, state, and local levels to address teacher shortages, and finally, provide some issues for consideration for the Legislature to think about as it begins to ask how to potentially deal with these shortages.",0.0
False,,"But first to provide a summary of the statewide teacher workforce trends. Two of the common trends that are assessed, or two of the common factors that are assessed by many in the research community, when gauging the health of the market for teachers are the number of new credentials issued in a given year, versus the number of hires that districts intend to make in a year and when we look at these two trends as you're receiving your handout, they're located on page two. We'll see that they're somewhat cyclical in nature.",0.0
False,,"The state undergoes periods of time in which we produce more credentials than teachers rehire, and vice versa. So it's about 2010 and '11, we have been hiring more teachers than we have been issuing credentials waiting some to site teachers shortages. However I want to stress that the market's more complex than these two factors and there are many other trends that we should should consider when engaging the true supply of teachers and the true demand for teachers.",0.0
False,,"When at looking at teacher demand the key factor sure to consider, is the level of funding, the state provides, via the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. We find that in about three quarters of the years in which the minimum guarantee grows year over year. We see an increase in projected hires at the district level. In recent years, we're providing, we have been providing more funding to districts, and as a result, we've been seeing more hiring. Similar trends are seen when we decrease the funding that via the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. Other key demand factors to consider are enrollment trends.",0.0
False,,"We seen over the past decade, enrollment has been fairly stagnant and Department of Finance projects that it'll be stagnant going forward into the near future, as well as class size policy, such as class size reduction efforts. When engaging the teachers' apply, I eluded to the number of credentials that are issued in a given year. If you look over the past 15 years, we've seen about a 70% decline in the number of credentials issued in California, but I want to stress that this was largely tracking a decrease in the number of hires the districts were making.",0.0
False,,"Basically, as fewer jobs were available, fewer teachers were entering the market. Other key sources of supply to consider are teachers who re-enter the work force and what we see is that various studies have estimated that about a quarter of all new hires are teachers who are returning to the work force after a leave of absence. Other, and the final key source of supply to consider is that of out of state recruitment and if we look over the past, basically over the life of Proposition 98 we see that about 20 percent of us teachers that California hires in any given year come from out of state prepared programs.",0.0
False,,"The final aspect of the market that I want to discuss is that of teacher turnover and various national studies have estimated that turnover stands about 15% of the teachers leave their jobs in a given year. About half of these teachers leave the profession all together while the other half switch school. So taking all this into account, we asked what is the overall evidence for market shortages? And while we do note that there is a current imbalance between the number of credentials being produced versus the number of hires the districts are making, we believe that this will begin to correct itself over time.",0.0
False,,"We note that the CTC has issued more credentials in the past year than it had in the prior. In conversations with various credentialing programs, we're seeing increased enrollment in these programs. We're seeing districts engage in robust out-of-state recruitment efforts, all of which we believe will help booey the supply of teachers. However despite these perhaps promising trends, we note that research perennially shows that there are persistent shortage areas being in key subject areas of special education, science and math teachers.",0.0
False,,"As well as certain types of schools such as city center schools, schools with high percentages of a student body who are low income, and rural schools. On page four of the hand out we summarized a number of key policies that have been implemented and rather than going into each one I just want to point out that we've grouped these into eight key policy category areas. I'll let you look at these at a later time, in the interest of being efficient.",0.0
False,,"Finally, when looking at all of this, we believe that it's important for the state to focus on those perennial shortage areas because these tend to exist both in kind of tough labor markets for schools and also easier labor markets for schools where there's a greater supply of teachers. Those being those key subject areas and those certain types of schools.",0.0
False,,"As far as various policies that have been implemented, in terms of financial incentives, ongoing salary increases can be more effective than one time bonuses because, while they serve the purpose of attracting teachers to the schools Initially they can also be effective at keeping the teachers there. When it comes to financial aid models, which the state has implemented various formats in the past, research tends to, while both up front tuition grants and loan forgiveness programs can be effective, research tends to point to up front tuition grants as being a more effective model.",0.0
False,,"As far as Supporting outreach policies these can be very effective at keeping teachers in the workforce and getting them to the workforce. New teachers' support programs which we were just discussing in the prior issue such as new teacher induction programs could be very effective if they're individualized to the teacher and focus on a strong mentor relationship. As far as support programs for ongoing teachers, this is really where effective administrators come into play and it's crucial for these administrators to be able to gauge some of the issues that teachers experience to be able to talk and coach them through some of the workplace issues they encounter.",0.0
False,,"Finally, as I mentioned, California is a source of a lot of teachers from out of state as well as teachers who are not actively teaching Have recruited them and pulled them back into the profession and we believe this is a key strategy for addressing teacher shortages in the short-term. I do want to to stress though, when assessing all of these different policies, we really rely on a fragmented set of research papers as opposed to any kind of robust labor market analysis. That's because the state lacks a longitudinal teacher database, where we can track a teacher throughout the duration of their career.",0.0
False,,"While certain elements are collected at various state agencies, we don't have the kind of comprehensive, robust, and periodic research approach that would allow us to gauge exactly what the market looks like and the true benefit and conduct a true and effective do cost benefit of analysis of all the various shortage intervention policies that have been attempted.

False,,"Good afternoon Madame Chair, Members of the Committee. My name is Brian Stiger, I'm the director for the Los Angeles County Department of Consumer Affairs. Over the past year, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has taken a number of steps to lift people out of poverty, and address the problem of homelessness. Once, its action was to raise the minimum wage in the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. On September 15th, 2015, the board passed a minimum wage ordinance that comes into effect on July 1st, 2016.",0.0
False,,"The ordinance requires employers with more than 26 employees to raise the minimum wage up to $10.50 an hour, which will then increase annually for the next four years, ultimately being at $15 an hour. For businesses that have 25 or fewer employees, that action is deferred for one year. In addition to passing the minimum wage ordinance the board took the necessary steps to ensure that employers actually pay minimum wage to workers as required by the ordinance and this is important because wage theft is widespread in Los Angeles County and one of the most common wage theft violations is failure to pay the minimum wage.",0.0
False,,"And the months leading up to the minimum wage adoption, we heard testimony from a number of wage theft victims during public hearings and all the way throughout Los Angeles County. As the Senator said we learn that victims of wage theft are disproportionately women and people of color.

False,,"Good afternoon, I'm Kelly Brooks. I'm speaking today on behalf of the California State Association of Counties. We are very supportive of the Medical 2020 waiver overall, and I've been asked today to speak specifically about the whole person care component.",0.0
False,,I think it's noteworthy for you all to recognize that the Whole Person Care pilot is the first time that a California waiver has included a project aimed at addressing the social determinants of health. I think there's been a lot of really good thought and discussion about how to address the triple aim and achieve better health outcomes for the varying populations within the Medic Help Program.,0.0
False,,"And I think the Whole Person Care pilot recognizes that no one entity is going to do this by themselves. The Medi-Cal Managed Care plans can't do it alone, the County Health Agencies aren't going to do it alone, County Specialty Mental Health plans can't do it by themselves, and certainly the providers in the community can't either. It really is a partnership across public and private systems, thinking about, how do we improve the overall of our communities?",0.0
False,,I think the pilots are a really great opportunity to sort of build on the local innovation that we know is already out there. I think counties are very comfortable in thinking about how to go forward with whole person care because of the successes of the low income health program and it's predecessor that covered initiatives.,0.0
False,,"I think we have a pretty high degree of interest amongst counties, both rural, urban, suburban, counties with hospitals, counties without hospitals and thinking about how this might be tailored to meet their local needs and address some really vexing issues around low income populations.",0.0
False,,"I would be remiss if I did not thank the Department of Healthcare Services for all their work leading to Medi-Cal 2020, whole person care evolved from the stakeholder process, it was not initially on DHCS's radar, but I think through really good collaboration and discussion, this became part of the final waiver package.",0.0
False,,"And they did a ton of work on thinking about the housing component, which is in the whole person care waiver. I'd also like to note that CSAC, along with CAPH, the County Behavioral Health Directors, the County Welfare Directors, the County Health Executives, the Local Health Plans of California, SEIU California, and the Corporation for Supportive Housing have all been working in collaboration to think about from the brain child of whole person care to, sort of, what it looks like through the waiver development.",0.0
False,,"And we continue to meet and offer learning collaboratives and opportunities for localities to figure out, okay, how would this work for us locally? What are the questions that we need answered so that we can go forward and send the applications? So I think one of the things that is really important to the Whole Person Care Pilot is the opportunity to build something that is sustainable beyond the five years of the waiver in thinking about the opportunity to reach across systems so that we're not so siloed to think about some infrastructure that could be put in place that potentially lasts beyond the five years, to think about how we share data across systems and how that becomes a way of doing business so that we're coordinating care in real time, so that we're getting as much information as possible about some of the really high users of multiple systems.",0.0
False,,"I think that is part of the incentive for folks to think about participating, is really this opportunity on the data and infrastructure side.",0.0
False,,I also think there is a lot of interest frankly because of the health income component. I think this opportunity aligns with a lot of discussions that are happening locally about how to address homelessness in their communities. It's a very interesting time with the Legislature and your interests and then the Assembly's interest as well in addressing housing and homelessness issues. And so I think this has people thinking about how housing and health fit together.,0.0

False,,"Good morning, Dan Caplan with the LAO. You should all be receiving a copy of a handout entitled Teacher Workforce Trends. I believe it's being passed out right now, but to provide a brief overview of what I'll be covering in the interim, I'll be discussing some recent trends in the labor market for teachers, evidence of shortage or shortage areas, a summary of prior policy responses attempted at the federal, state, and local levels to address teacher shortages, and finally, provide some issues for consideration for the Legislature to think about as it begins to ask how to potentially deal with these shortages.",0.0
False,,"But first to provide a summary of the statewide teacher workforce trends. Two of the common trends that are assessed, or two of the common factors that are assessed by many in the research community, when gauging the health of the market for teachers are the number of new credentials issued in a given year, versus the number of hires that districts intend to make in a year and when we look at these two trends as you're receiving your handout, they're located on page two. We'll see that they're somewhat cyclical in nature.",0.0
False,,"The state undergoes periods of time in which we produce more credentials than teachers rehire, and vice versa. So it's about 2010 and '11, we have been hiring more teachers than we have been issuing credentials waiting some to site teachers shortages. However I want to stress that the market's more complex than these two factors and there are many other trends that we should should consider when engaging the true supply of teachers and the true demand for teachers.",0.0
False,,"When at looking at teacher demand the key factor sure to consider, is the level of funding, the state provides, via the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. We find that in about three quarters of the years in which the minimum guarantee grows year over year. We see an increase in projected hires at the district level. In recent years, we're providing, we have been providing more funding to districts, and as a result, we've been seeing more hiring. Similar trends are seen when we decrease the funding that via the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. Other key demand factors to consider are enrollment trends.",0.0
False,,"We seen over the past decade, enrollment has been fairly stagnant and Department of Finance projects that it'll be stagnant going forward into the near future, as well as class size policy, such as class size reduction efforts. When engaging the teachers' apply, I eluded to the number of credentials that are issued in a given year. If you look over the past 15 years, we've seen about a 70% decline in the number of credentials issued in California, but I want to stress that this was largely tracking a decrease in the number of hires the districts were making.",0.0
False,,"Basically, as fewer jobs were available, fewer teachers were entering the market. Other key sources of supply to consider are teachers who re-enter the work force and what we see is that various studies have estimated that about a quarter of all new hires are teachers who are returning to the work force after a leave of absence. Other, and the final key source of supply to consider is that of out of state recruitment and if we look over the past, basically over the life of Proposition 98 we see that about 20 percent of us teachers that California hires in any given year come from out of state prepared programs.",0.0
False,,"The final aspect of the market that I want to discuss is that of teacher turnover and various national studies have estimated that turnover stands about 15% of the teachers leave their jobs in a given year. About half of these teachers leave the profession all together while the other half switch school. So taking all this into account, we asked what is the overall evidence for market shortages? And while we do note that there is a current imbalance between the number of credentials being produced versus the number of hires the districts are making, we believe that this will begin to correct itself over time.",0.0
False,,"We note that the CTC has issued more credentials in the past year than it had in the prior. In conversations with various credentialing programs, we're seeing increased enrollment in these programs. We're seeing districts engage in robust out-of-state recruitment efforts, all of which we believe will help booey the supply of teachers. However despite these perhaps promising trends, we note that research perennially shows that there are persistent shortage areas being in key subject areas of special education, science and math teachers.",0.0
False,,"As well as certain types of schools such as city center schools, schools with high percentages of a student body who are low income, and rural schools. On page four of the hand out we summarized a number of key policies that have been implemented and rather than going into each one I just want to point out that we've grouped these into eight key policy category areas. I'll let you look at these at a later time, in the interest of being efficient.",0.0
False,,"Finally, when looking at all of this, we believe that it's important for the state to focus on those perennial shortage areas because these tend to exist both in kind of tough labor markets for schools and also easier labor markets for schools where there's a greater supply of teachers. Those being those key subject areas and those certain types of schools.",0.0
False,,"As far as various policies that have been implemented, in terms of financial incentives, ongoing salary increases can be more effective than one time bonuses because, while they serve the purpose of attracting teachers to the schools Initially they can also be effective at keeping the teachers there.

False,,"As far as Supporting outreach policies these can be very effective at keeping teachers in the workforce and getting them to the workforce. New teachers' support programs which we were just discussing in the prior issue such as new teacher induction programs could be very effective if they're individualized to the teacher and focus on a strong mentor relationship. As far as support programs for ongoing teachers, this is really where effective administrators come into play and it's crucial for these administrators to be able to gauge some of the issues that teachers experience to be able to talk and coach them through some of the workplace issues they encounter.",0.0
False,,"Finally, as I mentioned, California is a source of a lot of teachers from out of state as well as teachers who are not actively teaching Have recruited them and pulled them back into the profession and we believe this is a key strategy for addressing teacher shortages in the short-term. I do want to to stress though, when assessing all of these different policies, we really rely on a fragmented set of research papers as opposed to any kind of robust labor market analysis. That's because the state lacks a longitudinal teacher database, where we can track a teacher throughout the duration of their career.",0.0

False,,"Yeah, there was over 1,300 in total, but I focused on the serious rape and murder arrests that had been made. It was asked whether or not these folks, would we have been able to fine them, was there a qualifying offense difference than these nine that we have reclassified?",0.0

False,,"I think what we have here is, and the question was asked by my articulate opponent on my left, and that's why is today different than what it was last year? And it's clear that it's different because we have some real data that we didn't have last year. And we now know that of those nine crimes that had been decriminalized that they contributed to the arrest of almost 200 rapists in the last 3 years and over 50 murderers.",0.0
False,,"And my articulate opponent raises the question of the convictions. How many led to a conviction? Well, as many know, our criminal justice system moves slowly, and that type of information would certainly be valuable, and it will come over time.",0.0
False,,"We did our own research, and others are welcome to do the same, to go back further than three years. And it may be able to look at that and determine how many convictions but 200 arrests for rapes is a pretty significant thing and 50 arrests for murders is pretty significant.",0.0
False,,"And would they have been solved, so another one of the issues that were raised was, would they have been solved without the DNA evidence? And it's the same point that I just answered a moment ago. Another was the high number of property crimes, and I've not focused on property crimes.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, there was over 1,300 in total, but I focused on the serious rape and murder arrests that had been made. It was asked whether or not these folks, would we have been able to fine them, was there a qualifying offense difference than these nine that we have reclassified?",0.0
False,,"And the information I get from the Attorney General is no, these are all the reclassified crimes, that's the data that was put in the database. The DNA database was from those arrests for those reclassified crimes, it wasn't for anything more serious than that list of nine, okay, than that list of nine.",0.0
False,,"Finally, concerns about the privacy of the DNA database those are serious concerns. I take them very seriously as we all should. And if there's abuse of the privacy of the DNA database, we should all look at that very carefully and see what can be done to have that never happen ever again. There's no iron clad where there is no database that hasn't been broken into by someone but we should all take that seriously in how we handle it.",0.0
False,,"And finally, Senator you raise the issue of false matches and those are also serious issues irrespective of this bill. If that is going on, if there's things we can do to avoid it, no one wants that to happen, that's part of what we expect out of our criminal justice system. But let me say this, that I do think of the nine crimes that we're talking about, there are a few that stand out as being more indicative of a more serious crime.",0.0
False,,"And I do think, if it's the will of the Committee and the chair to look for compromises, I think they can be found in trying to plug the hole of this data gap with I think three of those nine crimes, I think would go a long ways to trying to resolve this problem that has come about.",0.0
False,,And I think that I'd be open to putting those three crimes in and eliminating the other six for at least the sake of progress and trying to make sure that we're not letting rapist and murderers slip through the cracks.,0.0
False,,"Well, acting chair, Acting Chair Leno, may I respond?",0.0
False,,"We don't know what they would lead to or not lead to. But I also find that the swab and the exertion of DNA upon conviction of these other crimes to be something I wouldn't object to. And if that's the will of the body I'm happy to go in that direction. And finally that, of the-",0.0
False,,"So I would put that one first on my list. The second one that I would put on my list, would be possession of a narcotic controlled substance at the health and safety code, section 11350 A. Arrests for that crime in the last 3 years lead to 61 rape arrests and 19 murder arrests.",0.0
False,,"And the third that I would put on the list in order would be possession of a concentrated cannabis, health and safety code, section 11357 A. Arrest for that crime in the last 3 years led to the arrest of 17 rapists, and 2 murderers. And so those were three of the nine that seemed to have the strongest connection to future bad behaviors as we would say so.",0.0

False,,I never said that.,0.0

False,,"But I think that we're missing an opportunity here to take some controversy around Prop 47 and show that where we see that it has some shortfalls, we're willing to fix it and get it right because I think that one of the challenges for those who support Prop 47 is what you don't going to have is swings. You go back and forth where we tough and then we get soft and we get tough and then we get soft. And we know that in the long run that that's not healthy way to a run a criminal justice system.",0.0
False,,"And I think that where we have made these changes within Prop 47, I think the challenge for us, if you want to have support and sustainability for that type of reform, is to make sure that where we have some shortcomings, we fix them. And I think that's my biggest disappointment in working on this issue, is that, we spent over an hour talking about statue of limitations for rape going beyond 10 years.",0.0
False,,"And yet, that change would lead to how many more convictions? Nobody knows, nobody has any clue. Yet with this type of data, we know, we know. 196 rapists would not have been caught. Okay, I mean you could have said that we could have found them in other ways. But my big disappointment is that I think if you want 47 to be sustainable, it's to see where there are shortcomings and to fix them and this is the opportunity to do that.",0.0
False,,"I think it's not with nine classifications of crimes, you can do it with three and go 85% of the way. And I'll be disappointed that the Committee can't find a way to do that I think it's going to lead to an erosion of something that many Members of the Committee want, which is a more sustainable criminal justice policy that has the right balance.

And I know there is some opposition to this, and this will not in total solve the problem, but we can't just keep waiting for the magic bullet while we don't take the things that are available to us already within our grasp.",0.0
False,,"So this will create a pilot program only involving the nine Bay Area counties and adding in my county, San Joaquin County. A pilot program that will sunset in 2022, and because of evidence in other states, this cannot be a voluntary program, it will be a mandatory program.",0.0
False,,"So like I said, a bed registry is only one tool that will help. It will give psychiatrist and other mental health professionals a tool to help when there are crisis and need emergency care, when patients are in incredibly vulnerable or fragile states, their condition may be deteriorating rapidly, particularly if they are in danger of harming themselves or somebody else.",0.0
False,,"It's really important that they get into a bed as quickly as possible to start treatment. Currently, when someone needs a bed, the healthcare provider will start calling around. And I worked as a LCSW in a couple of hospital emergency rooms and I could tell you when crisis come in and if you don't have a bed in your facility and you try to find another one, it's just a panacea of trying to call and see where there's a bed, see where there's an open bed.",0.0
False,,"When you call, you can't get through. So this will create a registry where everyday in real time, it is updated, who has a bed, what is that bed for medically fragile, is that bed a lock unit, what are the parameters around that bed. So when somebody is coming in with an emergency, you need to place them quickly, you have way more knowledge and awareness of where that bed is open.",0.0
False,,"You still have to make those calls and say, alright, we have a patient, can you accept them? But it cuts down tremendously on the time, if you already have the data in front of you that says where are there beds open and available. The one state that has tried it in Virginia, but they did it more of a voluntary program.",0.0
False,,"And again if its voluntary its not going to be as robust as it will be if its mandatory. That created more problems than it fixed so that's why we're, rather than starting as a statewide rollout, to try it as a pilot first with counties. The Bay Area counties have already started a very integrated network, so they seem like the appropriate ones to start it off with.",0.0
False,,"Again, we don't say that this will fix everything. I am committed to working on mental health during my time here. This is one more step, provides one more tool, dealing with people when they are at their most fragile, sitting in emergency rooms. With me today, I have Randall Hagar from the Psychiatric Association and from the Steinberg Institute and Dr. Moline as an emergency room physician.",0.0
False,,"Well, that was the initial bill, Mr. Ridley-Thomas. The initial bill was to do it statewide. And as you can see from the private hospitals, you don't see the public hospitals up here objecting, from the private hospitals there is some resistance because change is hard. And so we thought a better way, and with the guidance of the Committee Staff and the Chair to just try to do it in a place that is already renowned for their integrated service as it is.",0.0

False,,"In working with the Committee, it was determined to be able to demonstrate if it's going to work or it's not going to work and to be able to iron out any kinks. We are a very large state, though we're close to 40 million people, to start with a pilot in an area that already has a high degree of integrated care.",0.0
False,,"Correct. It's a registry they already use. This will be just an added column. This is, again, one agency and one organization that provides this is already doing business in the Bay Area counties and has already helped them set up the registry for all the other issues that they.",0.0
False,,"And also in the State of Virginia, they have a different mental health system than we do. Ours, people with severe psychiatric conditions are in state hospitals, they're sort of out of the loop which is not the case of Virginia. So there was a lot more moving parts, and the system was not updated in the way that we imagined it should be updated.",0.0
False,,"Thank you. And yes, our intention is to continue to work on this. So I think people have been covered all the points and I will say as I said in the beginning and also as a researcher and a clinician. Nobody is questioning that there aren't enough beds. We need more beds but to not do anything while we wait for more beds is also is a, it's untenable.",0.0
False,,"So again, this is one step, it's a pilot. We think it's going to be effective. We won't know until we actually implement it. It certainly can't be worse than the system that we currently have in place. And I respectfully ask for you aye vote.",0.0

While we appreciate the efforts of the author and sponsors to address our initial concerns with an earlier version of the bill, we cannot remove our opposition at this time.",0.0
False,,The amendments made for the screening requirements do not mirror what is currently in the United States preventative task force recommendations. This bill prescribes a colonoscopy with polyp removal to be used after the age of 50 with no cost sharing.,0.0
False,,"My members report that the use of a specific age is problematic, because they don't differentiate cost savings based on enrollee's age. In addition, this type of procedure is not recommended for an individual over the age of 75. There's no cap on the screening requirement currently in the bill.

False,,"For example, the 6 first line regiments for non small cell lung cancer range from $450 to more than $60,000 in costs, for 3 months with no difference in outcomes. All of these are reasons why health systems, drug distributors and health plans, among others, have developed pathways for cancer treatment.",0.0
False,,"Pathways are voluntary programs aimed at helping providers ensure their patients get clinically appropriate quality care with minimal side effects. Let me emphasize, they are voluntary. At least the voluntary pathways developed by health plans, do not interfere with doctors, deciding which therapy they believe is best for the patient. They also do not interfere with innovation or clinical trials.",0.0
False,,They're simply one of many ways in which the healthcare system is trying to develop more evidence-based treatment programs and options. CAHP opposes AB 2209 because it unfairly singles out health plans and subjects their pathways and programs to unneeded government regulation. It assumes a need for statutory guidelines without imposing those same standards on other pathways that are developed by other entities.,0.0
False,,"The proponents have demonstrated no evidence at singling out health plan pathways is warranted for regulation, nor have they demonstrated a problem that they hope to fix with the bill. Why should only voluntary health plan pathways be subject to the standards of this bill? The proponents themselves stated in their opening testimony",0.0
False,,"that they believe that the health plan pathways should be held up to the same standards as other guidelines. Well, then if that's the case, then everybody's pathway should be subject to the standards of this bill, whether it's a health plan, drug distributor or a medical system. Isn't it reasonable to think that a pathway developed by a drug distributor might prevent access to clinical trials of a competitor drug?",0.0
False,,"It's not clear at all why the standards proposing this bill would not be applied to pathways developed by others. We should place the same standards on pathways in clinical drug trials in which providers are paid by the drug makers for participating. Quite frankly, that situation sounds more troublesome than a voluntary set of guidelines. So this is just one of the concerns that we have with the bill, that we believe is unnecessary.",0.0

False,,"We know that 16% of people living in California suffer from some kind of mental health issue. And less than 60% of those receive any treatment. And as a mental health provider, I can tell you that one of the biggest indicators for somebody to turn around their episode, is the more quickly they can get services, the better chances they are of a better recovery.",0.0
False,,"So, what we're talking about here is developing a registry, a real time registry, where there are open psychiatric beds. And I know there is some opposition to this, and this will not in total solve the problem, but we can't just keep waiting for the magic bullet while we don't take the things that are available to us already within our grasp.",0.0
False,,"So this will create a pilot program only involving the nine Bay Area counties and adding in my county, San Joaquin County. A pilot program that will sunset in 2022, and because of evidence in other states, this cannot be a voluntary program, it will be a mandatory program.",0.0
False,,"So like I said, a bed registry is only one tool that will help. It will give psychiatrist and other mental health professionals a tool to help when there are crisis and need emergency care, when patients are in incredibly vulnerable or fragile states, their condition may be deteriorating rapidly, particularly if they are in danger of harming themselves or somebody else.",0.0
False,,"It's really important that they get into a bed as quickly as possible to start treatment. Currently, when someone needs a bed, the healthcare provider will start calling around. And I worked as a LCSW in a couple of hospital emergency rooms and I could tell you when crisis come in and if you don't have a bed in your facility and you try to find another one, it's just a panacea of trying to call and see where there's a bed, see where there's an open bed.",0.0
False,,"When you call, you can't get through. So this will create a registry where everyday in real time, it is updated, who has a bed, what is that bed for medically fragile, is that bed a lock unit, what are the parameters around that bed. So when somebody is coming in with an emergency, you need to place them quickly, you have way more knowledge and awareness of where that bed is open.",0.0
False,,"You still have to make those calls and say, alright, we have a patient, can you accept them?

False,,"And again if its voluntary its not going to be as robust as it will be if its mandatory.

False,,"And also in the State of Virginia, they have a different mental health system than we do.

False,,"Thank you. And yes, our intention is to continue to work on this. So I think people have been covered all the points and I will say as I said in the beginning and also as a researcher and a clinician. Nobody is questioning that there aren't enough beds.

They also do not interfere with innovation or clinical trials.",0.0
False,,They're simply one of many ways in which the healthcare system is trying to develop more evidence-based treatment programs and options. CAHP opposes AB 2209 because it unfairly singles out health plans and subjects their pathways and programs to unneeded government regulation. It assumes a need for statutory guidelines without imposing those same standards on other pathways that are developed by other entities.,0.0
False,,"The proponents have demonstrated no evidence at singling out health plan pathways is warranted for regulation, nor have they demonstrated a problem that they hope to fix with the bill. Why should only voluntary health plan pathways be subject to the standards of this bill? The proponents themselves stated in their opening testimony",0.0
False,,"that they believe that the health plan pathways should be held up to the same standards as other guidelines. Well, then if that's the case, then everybody's pathway should be subject to the standards of this bill, whether it's a health plan, drug distributor or a medical system. Isn't it reasonable to think that a pathway developed by a drug distributor might prevent access to clinical trials of a competitor drug?",0.0
False,,"It's not clear at all why the standards proposing this bill would not be applied to pathways developed by others.

The rate methodology as it's evolving, we're not sure what continued to incentivize that. There's really no mechanism that would give a PACE program credit if you will, if they did a better job even in, terms of keeping people out.

False,,But hopefully you can see how difficult this is when you're trying to protect what I call the one innocent. It's just extremely difficult to do that.

False,,"And doesn't mean we couldn't make a mistake, I think everybody here, that'd be horrifying if any of us, no one supports that. But I think there are protections in place to make sure that doesn't happen. And the voters knowing that is in place still support the death penalty.",0.0
False,,"And we're not going back and forth, but I would submit that we probably don't have any evidence that an innocent person may have been put to death, once someone's put to death as some of my colleagues on here have said they can no longer one commit another murder, but subsequently, we're not going out and trying to prove that they're innocent after they've been put to death.",0.0

For DWR there's an increase of 5 million for emergency drinking water, which was also discussed in this, so that's one of the big redirections.

False,,"Mr. President, Members, I rise in support of this legislation. When the Legislature passed many years ago a ban on assault weapons which was signed by the Governor.

Representations were made that heroin dealers could get a license under the AUMA. That is simply not true. In order to believe that one would have to believe that Lori Ajax, the head of the bureau, would knowingly give a license to somebody who is a heroin dealer. That is not true. The initiative simply says that a prior for certain drug related offenses is not automatically disqualified. If somebody's engaged in trafficking white China heroine, or cocaine or whatever the case may be, you can bet that they're engaged in other unlawful activities, tax evasion.",0.0
False,,"And what we definitely know is they're engaged in unlicensed sales of controlled substances. And so the conviction, the penal conviction, may not be automatically disqualified, but those other offenses are absolutely grounds that the administrative agency can deny a license on. So simply, this concern about heroin dealers getting licenses with respect is just simply not true.",0.0
False,,"Well, I think again we were trying to strike a careful balance between insuring that the regulators had the discretion in here. There's no question this provision gives the regulators the discretion to deny the license.",0.0
False,,"What we wanted to do was in a similar way to what was done in the medical legislation, give the regulators the ability to find that somebody has been rehabilitated. It is true we did not do it the exact same way, but the end result is no different. The regulators have the flexibility to look at a prior offense and determine whether or not somebody is sufficiently rehabilitated to have a license. And if they don't conclude that that's the case, they are not required to get a license. Nobody's entitled to a license.",0.0
False,,"Well, again, I feel like we're spending the time on controlled substance versus limitation to just marijuana. True enough it says, controlled substance, but we're forgetting that is the sole grounds. The simple existence of that one prior conviction in of itself is not solely disqualified, but those types of convictions rarely occur in isolation. Again, if somebody is selling a controlled substance without a license, that is grounds for denial of a license period. So I think again, without simply focusing on the terms solely is a little limiting, I would say.",0.0
False,,"Well, I did want to spend a moment if I may with respect to the Advisory Committee. I believe Mr. Lovell referred to it, as an opportunity for industry representatives to identify regulations that could be struck down and to essentially help lawyers to build their practices. I think if you actually read the text of 2614, you'll see something quite different. First of all, the Advisory Committee is very similar to the Advisory Committee under the medical legislation. You want to have an Advisory Committee, it makes sense to have an Advisory Committee as these regulatory agencies get up and running. You want to have, as the AUMA does. An Advisory Committee that helps provide guidance on best practices and guidelines that protect the public health, and safety. I'm on page 14.",0.0

Add on to that houses and other properties that are sold during a year, and then are reassessed at their current market value.",0.0

And while our office hasn't necessarily raised any issues with the potentiality of research in this area, we have raised some concerns with the administration's proposal.",0.0
False,,"Sort of broadly speaking providing state general fund for direct research funding is not a role that the state has commonly played. Much of the state's research institutions receive their funding from federal, private, and other non-state general fund sources.",0.0
False,,"And because of this proposal, raises some questions about how the state should prioritize funding. In this area versus many other potentially worthy areas of research. Our office suggested a few criteria the Legislature might want to consider.",0.0
False,,"In particular, is there a good argument that there is a lack of a federal and private activity in this area, and funding in this area that the state might need to play some role so that there is adequate funding here. A second consideration is whether or not this research would provide some type of benefit that is uniquely important to California and its residents.",0.0
False,,And I think based on these criteria we found it hard to justify providing funding for this particular area of research over many other potentially worthwhile Research ventures. We also had some concerns about sort of just the administration of the program.,0.0
False,,"In particular, the sort of lack of clarity on how some of the funds would be spent, particularly the administrative funds, which is potentially about a million and a half of the funding here. The use of those funds, the amount, and the number of staff that would fund, that has been fluctuating throughout our conversation with the administration.",0.0
False,,"And we're still, sort of, lacking some clarity about how that would be spent, so we have some concern there as well. Because of all this, we have recommended the Legislature reject this proposal, and the staff recommendation on this item is to reject.",0.0

Additionally, it wasn't clear where they would be located and how that would happen, as well. We'd recommend in rejecting the proposal.",0.0
False,,You'll note that the Committee staff recommendation is to approve $10 million for 27 of those apparatus.,0.0
False,,"So the administration's proposal was framed as both replacement and a new apparatus. We would note that the replacements, though, are needed because our understanding is that the department used funding that was typically available for replacing engines and actually used them over the last couple of years to purchase new engines.",0.0
False,,"Which is why they need some funding for replacement engines now because they used that funding elsewhere. So, but it's correct that that's what it's intended for. Okay.And then the next item I believe that you wanted to discuss was the fire and rescue branch staffing, which is very much related to the fire apparatus.",0.0
False,,"The governor's proposal was $2.5 million and 12 positions to support basically maintenance activities, as well as coordination activities with these new fire apparatus. We recommended rejecting this. We felt that the staffing wasn't needed for",0.0
False,,the new engines because we were recommending rejecting those new engines. And we didn't think the department provided a case to support that their existing staffing was insufficient to meet their needs for their existing workload. You'll note that the staff recommendation here was to approve $1.7 1 million,0.0
False,,"and 7 positions, which is consistent with the staff recommendation related to the number of engines. If you turn to page 4, sorry, if you turn to page 5, since we're skipping, I think, a couple of items. Statewide Disaster Programs.",0.0
False,,"This is one of several different pieces related to disaster coordination. And this one's actually particularly complex. You'll notice that there are actually five separate components of this proposal. In total, they add to $5 million in general fund increase.",0.0
False,,"And there's actually a reduction of $3.9 million in federal funds. There's also two positions that are proposed as part of this, this particular piece of the proposal. So I'll just walk you through the five components very quickly if I may. And they're actually within three different kind of sub-programs, if you will.",0.0
False,,"So it is a little bit complex. The first two are really related to recovery public assistance. And this is basically a program that the department uses to process disaster claims. And you'll see that the first one is an increase in general fund of about $3.5 million,",0.0
False,,"and it's a reduction of federal funds of about $3.1 million. The department's rationale for this was an increase in workload that's not eligible for federal dollars. And their two main reasons why this workload wouldn't be eligible, one is that the workload could be for state-only disasters, so basically disasters that weren't declared as Federal disasters by the Federal Government.",0.0
False,,"Also, in some cases there are Federal disasters, but the state hasn't been able to close out those disasters within an eight-year period. And if the state doesn't close them out within eight years, then they're no longer eligible for federal dollars. The second piece is $188,000 to address a backlog of state only claims.",0.0
False,,So there is some backlog of these claims. They're anticipating closing out that backlog over a three year period. The next two components are related to their hazard mitigation program. This is a program that creates and reviews hazard mitigation plans for both the state and local governments.,0.0
False,,So the first piece is another of these adjustments in state and federal funding. You'll note that it's about $1 million increase in state general fund that's proposed and about $1 million decrease in federal funds authority that administration has indicated that the reason for this is that they haven't had a consistent federal grants and,0.0
False,,"so they can't rely on federal grant money to fund these activities. And then the next piece is related to staffing. There are two positions that are proposed, largely for climate adaptation workload. Then the final component is-",0.0
False,,Sure.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, I believe there may be some additional costs in there. The proposal only spoke to the two positions that I'm aware of. The administration may have more details on that, but I believe the only thing that was described in the proposal was the two positions. And then the final component was related to the pre-disaster and flood mitigation program and",0.0
False,,"that's a program that awards grants for disaster planning and projects and that's actually more of a technical adjustment to realign. And it's actually a reduction in general fund spending of $222,000 to realign state and federal funding based on the actual match requirements of that grant program. So we just noted sort of overall that there wasn't a lot of detail.",0.0
False,,"We did recommend approving $188,000 in general funds to address that backlog. We certainly think if there's a backlog of these claims that they need to be addressed. However just overall in terms of those shifts between state funding and federal funding we didn't think the department was able to make a compelling case that this was really the appropriate state and federal funding next.",0.0
False,,"So for example for the recovery public assistance program we noted that this is actually a very large increase in their general fund support, about 65% increase for that program and it wasn't clear that the increase in workload, the new workload was that large. They didn't provide data to substantiate that and it wasn't also clear you know they've",0.0
False,,"seen just a tremendous backlog or redirection, all those things may have happened. We didn't receive any data that substantiated to that kind of increase to necessitate a $3.5 million increase in general funds. Similarly, with the hazard mitigation piece, that additional $1 million of state general fund, the administration indicated that that was needed because there wasn't consistent federal funding.",0.0
False,,"While this may be the case, where we ask for data on the past awards that the state had received. Actually, there was an increase in the last year or two, in terms of the amount, and it was just aggregated by state and local. So, we understand some of that, a large portion of that, or potentially all of it, may have gone to locals, but",0.0
False,,"it just wasn't clear to us that there's a reason why the state couldn't access those grant funds. So then we also noted just on those positions that it wasn't clear to us what role the department was going to have in terms of climate adaptation, and how those additional positions would be utilized. So we'd note also the staff recommendation was to approve the 188,000 in general funds.",0.0
False,,"And if you turn to page six, the regional response and readiness. This is also related to disaster coordination. The Governor's proposing $2 million in 13 positions. This group basically interacts with local, state, federal government related to various disasters.",0.0
False,,"Our recommendation was to reject this piece of the proposal as well. The department had some anecdotal evidence about increased threats driving this need. However, there wasn't any data that they were able to provide that really substantiated that, and the justification for these 13 positions. And then our rationale was very similar with the law enforcement branch staffing increase.",0.0
False,,"The governor's proposal was $1.7 million in six positions in this area, we recommended rejecting for very similar reasons. The staff recommendation was $1.1 million in four positions.",0.0
False,,"But then, maybe the last two items, where there's some difference you might want to address would be under the other category FEMA and emergency operations instance support training.",0.0
False,,"Sure. I can provide a brief summary of those. The Federal Emergency Management Program. It's on page 10 of your handout. So the Governor is proposing $700,000.00 and essentially what the Governor is proposing is replacing some",0.0
False,,inclined match that the states been providing with a cash match and this will allow them to perform additional activities. We're recommending rejecting this because they just didn't justify really what those activities were and why they were needed. So certainly they'll be able to do more if they have additional cash but there wasn't a clear justification there. And then the next component emergency operations incidents support training.,0.0
False,,"The Governor was proposing a 169,000 for additional specialized training. We recommended rejecting that as well. We noted that it wasn't clear what this additional specialized training would be. And what the additional benefits would be from that training. On both of those items, the staff recommendation was also to reject.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0.0
False,,"Sure, well. One more. Or really, would you please respond to that?. Absolutely. So based on the data we received, there were I think about 33,000 requests in total. So all this last year was particularly bad in terms of fires and there were more needs, certainly than in other years.",0.0
False,,"Even with that particularly tough fire year, really it was a very small fraction of those requests that went unfilled. And so we certainly think that while there's certainly value in additional trucks, it's not clear to us that the those trucks would be needed at this level and ongoing basis.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chairman, do we know what the Assembly has done on this to understand more clearly whether this conversation will continue on beyond this hearing? That is a reasonable question. Given the complexity of this, I don't know exactly what they're doing but I would place a very strong bet that it will not be identical to what we're doing.",0.0

False,,"Of that amount, 3 and a half billion is related to increases from 2015-16 to 2016-17. And the remainder is related to increases in estimates of the prior year guarantee and some one time resources. The total minimum guarantee under the Senate package is $71.9 billion in 2016-17. And that reflects a 64 million increase over the May revision estimates for that year.",0.0
False,,"Of that increase, 54 million is related to your recent adoption of the LAO property tax estimates. Although the bulk of those estimates offset the state's general fund obligation, they also result in a small increase to the total Proposition 98 funding level. In addition, the Committee took action to adjust, or what we call rebench, the guarantee for the education component of the savings associated with Proposition 47 and that increases the guarantee by an additional $10 million.",0.0
False,,"In terms of specific spending decisions, the centerpiece of the Senate package is an allocation of $3.1 billion to continue the implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula.",0.0
False,,"In addition, the Senate package also includes $1.2 billion to pay down outstanding mandates for K-12 schools and an additional $106 million for the California Community Colleges. The Senate package does include some differences from the administration. I won't go through all of those, but I'll just cover a few at very high level detail.",0.0
False,,"So the specific differences for K-12 schools include $200 million on a one time basis for college readiness block grants. This is funding that schools would use to prepare students to be eligible for post-secondary institutions, as well as to increase the four year graduation rate.",0.0
False,,"So that might be used on such activities as counseling, or professional development, or instructional materials. The Senate package includes $60 million on a one time basis to create or expand teacher residency programs. These would be targeted toward key shortage areas, like special education and would give prospective teachers the opportunity to meet with, and learn from, more experienced mentor teachers.",0.0
False,,And the Senate package includes $45 million for the California Collaborative and Education Excellence. This is funding that would be used for statewide training for all districts regarding the new evaluation rubrics that are being adopted by the State Board of Education.,0.0
False,,"Finally, the Senate Package also rejects the $100 million that the administration had proposed for the Emergency Repair Revolving Loan program. In terms, shifting gears a little bit to the community colleges, I think the changes there are a little bit smaller. The Senate package would redirect $30 million that the administration had proposed for the basic skills initiative, and instead put that towards a transformation grant applications that have not received funding.",0.0
False,,"I think there were 22 applications that weren't funded in that program, and so the Senate package would redirect money toward that purpose. In addition, the package includes $10 million for an increase to apportionment. So this is base funding that the colleges can use for any local purpose.",0.0
False,,"And it would reject the May revision proposal to provide $25 million for innovation awards. Lastly, regarding preschool, there's $35 million in Proposition 98 funding to increase the standard reimbursement rate by 4%. With that, happy to answer any questions you may have about the package.",0.0
False,,"Sure, so, as far as the difference there, I think the Senate package is paying out a little bit less in the mandate backlog. It's the similar amount for the community colleges, but a difference of, I believe, about $180 million from the May revision to the Senate package for K-12 schools.",0.0
False,,The state has made substantial progress on the backlog over the past few years.,0.0
False,,"One issue that's come up now is that because the proposal is to provide all of the funding on a pre-pupil basis, more and more of that funding is going to districts that don't necessarily have outstanding claims. But the bulk of the backlog it's, we're down to just about a few billion I think, for community colleges. I think it's all but eliminated for one district for K-12 schools. Most districts today no longer have any outstanding claims.",0.0
False,,"For the mandate backlog, there's really no specific timeline set forth in the constitution or in statute. There's been litigation over this in the past, but the court have not required the state to adhere to any specific timeline for that repayment.",0.0
False,,Yeah I think you do. It's been a moving piece in several of the past discussions at the Committee level and in conference. And so just seeing that you have some discretion as far as exactly how quickly you pay them down.,0.0
False,,"For the proposed allocation for K-12 schools, it's $1.2 billion. I think we're estimating that about half of that would go toward reducing the backlog, maybe a little bit less for community colleges. It's $106 million that's going toward the backlog.",0.0
False,,Thank you Mr. Chair. I appreciate the candid conversation and those who want to try to find a way to move forward. I guess what's missing for me is any kind of explanation of the accountability for the mistakes. Were these architects?,0.0

False,,"I guess I'm looking for your guidance as to what is appropriate for us in terms of reporting back about a vendor. There's a lot of projects we do in the state where the vendors are very visible. And if it's a failure rate, everybody knows it's a failure, and that's part of the public record. And I guess I don't like the idea that somehow, we have a problem, it seems to be an anonymous problem, at least given what's been provided to us today.",0.0

Mr. Chairman, I was wondering if we could ask the administration to in light of this potential legal threat to the cap in trade spending What is the contingency plan in case the judgment goes against the administration and our ability to assess this fee? What alternatives do you think are going to be available to us if we spend this money?",0.0
False,,"Right and I'm not an expert on litigation, but I thought that part of the challenge is the ability, the authority of the administration to actually assess this fee or tax or however you're going to interpret it. So it's not really necessarily just about how you spend the money, but whether or not you, we have exceeded our authorization in assessing that fee or tax, how you define it. Is that also part of the litigation?",0.0
False,,"My question is, does the administration have a contingency plan in case we were to lose that litigation, even though you have a high confidence level and I appreciate that. Is there a contingency plan that if we spend this money, then what do we do if we were to lose that case?",0.0
False,,"Right, but how much money is at risk to date if you allowed this spending to go forward, how much money now is at risk were we to lose that case? I understand your point which is that we're not spending at all. But, how much have we spent and how much if you add on to what we're proposing?",0.0
False,,Do you think we've spent $1 billion to date?,0.0
False,,"Right, but I'm talking about what we have spent and we were required to pay it back. So it sounds like you're saying it is about 4 billion through the end of this next fiscal year that we would have at risk. Is that correct?",0.0

And we didn't think the department provided a case to support that their existing staffing was insufficient to meet their needs for their existing workload. You'll note that the staff recommendation here was to approve $1.7 1 million,0.0
False,,"and 7 positions, which is consistent with the staff recommendation related to the number of engines. If you turn to page 4, sorry, if you turn to page 5, since we're skipping, I think, a couple of items. Statewide Disaster Programs.",0.0
False,,"This is one of several different pieces related to disaster coordination. And this one's actually particularly complex. You'll notice that there are actually five separate components of this proposal. In total, they add to $5 million in general fund increase.",0.0
False,,"And there's actually a reduction of $3.9 million in federal funds. There's also two positions that are proposed as part of this, this particular piece of the proposal. So I'll just walk you through the five components very quickly if I may. And they're actually within three different kind of sub-programs, if you will.",0.0
False,,"So it is a little bit complex. The first two are really related to recovery public assistance. And this is basically a program that the department uses to process disaster claims. And you'll see that the first one is an increase in general fund of about $3.5 million,",0.0
False,,"and it's a reduction of federal funds of about $3.1 million. The department's rationale for this was an increase in workload that's not eligible for federal dollars. And their two main reasons why this workload wouldn't be eligible, one is that the workload could be for state-only disasters, so basically disasters that weren't declared as Federal disasters by the Federal Government.",0.0
False,,"Also, in some cases there are Federal disasters, but the state hasn't been able to close out those disasters within an eight-year period. And if the state doesn't close them out within eight years, then they're no longer eligible for federal dollars. The second piece is $188,000 to address a backlog of state only claims.",0.0
False,,So there is some backlog of these claims. They're anticipating closing out that backlog over a three year period. The next two components are related to their hazard mitigation program. This is a program that creates and reviews hazard mitigation plans for both the state and local governments.,0.0
False,,So the first piece is another of these adjustments in state and federal funding. You'll note that it's about $1 million increase in state general fund that's proposed and about $1 million decrease in federal funds authority that administration has indicated that the reason for this is that they haven't had a consistent federal grants and,0.0
False,,"so they can't rely on federal grant money to fund these activities. And then the next piece is related to staffing. There are two positions that are proposed, largely for climate adaptation workload. Then the final component is-",0.0
False,,Sure.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, I believe there may be some additional costs in there. The proposal only spoke to the two positions that I'm aware of. The administration may have more details on that, but I believe the only thing that was described in the proposal was the two positions. And then the final component was related to the pre-disaster and flood mitigation program and",0.0
False,,"that's a program that awards grants for disaster planning and projects and that's actually more of a technical adjustment to realign. And it's actually a reduction in general fund spending of $222,000 to realign state and federal funding based on the actual match requirements of that grant program. So we just noted sort of overall that there wasn't a lot of detail.",0.0
False,,"We did recommend approving $188,000 in general funds to address that backlog. We certainly think if there's a backlog of these claims that they need to be addressed. However just overall in terms of those shifts between state funding and federal funding we didn't think the department was able to make a compelling case that this was really the appropriate state and federal funding next.",0.0
False,,"So for example for the recovery public assistance program we noted that this is actually a very large increase in their general fund support, about 65% increase for that program and it wasn't clear that the increase in workload, the new workload was that large. They didn't provide data to substantiate that and it wasn't also clear you know they've",0.0
False,,"seen just a tremendous backlog or redirection, all those things may have happened. We didn't receive any data that substantiated to that kind of increase to necessitate a $3.5 million increase in general funds. Similarly, with the hazard mitigation piece, that additional $1 million of state general fund, the administration indicated that that was needed because there wasn't consistent federal funding.",0.0
False,,"While this may be the case, where we ask for data on the past awards that the state had received. Actually, there was an increase in the last year or two, in terms of the amount, and it was just aggregated by state and local. So, we understand some of that, a large portion of that, or potentially all of it, may have gone to locals, but",0.0
False,,"it just wasn't clear to us that there's a reason why the state couldn't access those grant funds. So then we also noted just on those positions that it wasn't clear to us what role the department was going to have in terms of climate adaptation, and how those additional positions would be utilized. So we'd note also the staff recommendation was to approve the 188,000 in general funds.",0.0

False,,"Our recommendation was to reject this piece of the proposal as well. The department had some anecdotal evidence about increased threats driving this need. However, there wasn't any data that they were able to provide that really substantiated that, and the justification for these 13 positions. And then our rationale was very similar with the law enforcement branch staffing increase.",0.0
False,,"The governor's proposal was $1.7 million in six positions in this area, we recommended rejecting for very similar reasons. The staff recommendation was $1.1 million in four positions.",0.0
False,,"But then, maybe the last two items, where there's some difference you might want to address would be under the other category FEMA and emergency operations instance support training.",0.0
False,,"Sure. I can provide a brief summary of those. The Federal Emergency Management Program. It's on page 10 of your handout. So the Governor is proposing $700,000.00 and essentially what the Governor is proposing is replacing some",0.0
False,,inclined match that the states been providing with a cash match and this will allow them to perform additional activities. We're recommending rejecting this because they just didn't justify really what those activities were and why they were needed. So certainly they'll be able to do more if they have additional cash but there wasn't a clear justification there. And then the next component emergency operations incidents support training.,0.0
False,,"The Governor was proposing a 169,000 for additional specialized training. We recommended rejecting that as well. We noted that it wasn't clear what this additional specialized training would be. And what the additional benefits would be from that training.

False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0.0
False,,"Sure, well. One more. Or really, would you please respond to that?. Absolutely. So based on the data we received, there were I think about 33,000 requests in total. So all this last year was particularly bad in terms of fires and there were more needs, certainly than in other years.",0.0
False,,"Even with that particularly tough fire year, really it was a very small fraction of those requests that went unfilled.
