False,,"We're here today, backing up the letter of support we filed in support of Mr. Doyle.  We think he's a fine guy for this job. I do want to make a couple comments though, related to some of the issues that we would ask you to keep a close watch on as this moves forward.",0.0
False,,"And it also, as the next appointment comes up, which is for the director's position. There's a few things going on right now, that are quite relevant to what's going to happen with this population and we absolutely look forward working to Mr. Doyle.",0.0
False,,They're looking forward to working with Mr. Doyle on these issues.  The federal government's come down recently with some massive changes proposed to the CMS guidelines that guide the funding relationship we have with the federal government for this population.,0.0
False,,"A lot of the direction they're seeking promotes independence in a model where people should be living as independently as they can out of the community among us.  That's absolutely the right spirit that we are all, you know, should be heading in the direction of.",0.0
False,,"However, some of the speed with which they want to move, could threaten a lot of people out in the community, in your districts, today and their family members who have certain arrangements set up and programs that they work with the individuals in the agencies in their community and, you know, literally if the federal government were allowed to move forward and some of the guidelines that with literally throw people out of existing programs because it wouldn't be funded anymore under federal funding.",0.0
False,,"And, we've got to keep a careful watch on that.  I think we're also at a point in time, where everybody would agree that the system has been, at least in the community which serves 270,000 Californians and their families every day, we are at a point of chronic underfunding.",0.0
False,,"And, we're looking for more from the department than just simply doing their job and following along in the budget process.  We are looking for leadership, we're looking for proposals to this body that will help fix these situations, and we ask that there be careful contemplation of policies like, for example, removing exclusions from over time or ...",0.0

I can't imagine living every day in the place where I was abused, with perpetrators or people who investigated these crimes being allowed to walk freely among there.",0.0
False,,"And, that wouldn't happen in the community.  In the community, people would be arrested, they would be prosecuted, programs to be closed.",0.0
False,,"The last thing on the developmental centers, it is a great idea to look at other uses.  We would ask the department and Mr. Doyle to look very carefully at the proposition of the $500,000,000 that we spend in the operations of developmental centers today and, probably, the $700,000,000 in property that we have today and look at some transfer of those assets into the community to address those problems that were raised earlier.",0.0
False,,We like Mr. Doyle  a great deal.  He has a great background for this with Department of Finance.  We've worked with him there.  We trust him to be a good person in this regard and we urge your confirmation. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Jennifer Kuhn, Leg. Analyst. So, when the state started implementing the LCFF, that base year, it was 72% of funded. It had more generous targets and it knew that it would take a number of years to get up to those targets. Under the governor's budget we've estimated for 2015/2016, so just a few years later the state would be 85% funded. So it made considerable progress. It would be slightly ahead of schedule in that regard. Having said that though, because the targets are COLAed, you have to have growth in the guarantee that's quite a bit faster than COLA to make a serious dent in to getting there. Under our 5 year forecast, we have the last year of the period at about 90 some percent funded. So, still it would take again a number of years. Although we appear to be on track, it really depends on what happens to the guarantee moving forward. It's very straightforward to calculate. If we were at the full rates today, it would cost the state $57 billion and $9 billion of it would be associated with supplemental concentration funding for English learners and low-income students.",0.0
False,,"It's not quite as easy to say exactly how much that we're giving out can be associated with those students because it's really based on what they were given, and a closing of the gap, but what we do know by design how much they're supposed to get and some day we'll know exactly how much they're getting. In the end term we are really relying on these plans to have districts described to us what they're doing. So at a minimum we can at least know what they're telling us they are doing.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Madame Chair. As many of you know, I've been a big advocate of the courts and fought like heck to ensure that the trial court's get as much funding. Hopefully, you have seen the recent audit by the state auditor, which was very enlightening and unbelievably disturbing in a lot of ways. I might be one that on this panel that may be looking at doing things another way, at cutting the court budget because of some of the problems that we see in that while trial court rooms are being closed all across this state for lack of funds. We're paying about 8 managers $179,000, more than your boss the governor, more than the general manager department of general services who manages thousands of employees, which is about 800 employees, averaging about $28,000 than anybody else at that same level.",0.0
False,,"In addition, they're maintaining the fleet about 66 cars. 7.2 million employees are part time and could have been done by the trial courts, but they're being charged for that. There is about $30 million in questionable court spending and salaries. The audit points out about $186 million that could go directly to trial courts, which everyone who was here the last two years on the budget, that I've been here, that was the number one priority: getting money to the trial court. It looks like there's hundreds of millions not getting to them because AOC and judicial council. I was the director of real estate. We're leasing space in San Francisco, instead of here in Sacramento.",0.0
False,,"People aren't together with their managers and with their employees. I'll do it for free. I used to be Director of Real Estate. I will get that done pretty quick. So, this kind of Marie Antoinette feeling ""let them eat cake"", I know it is only 4.2% of the budget, but those individuals make 100% of the decisions on the budget. I just want to know if the governor has any -  I know that the audit came out about the same time as the budget coming out, but he does he have any feelings on what we can do? Should we start by cutting it by $93 million until they can prove that they can come up with a over $186 million worth of savings and efficiencies because I'm trying to get a quarter-of-a-billion back to the trial courts, which we can do if everyone's cooperative on the judicial council and AOC side.",0.0
False,,"Thank you.  My name's Will Barrett.  I'm a senior policy analyst for the American Lung Association of California.  I'm also speaking today for the Coalition for Clean Air and the 70 organizations that make-up the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition, or CVAQC.",0.0
False,,"We're all in strong support of Dr. Capitman's appointment to the governing board today and urge you to move this forward.  As you heard, Dr. Capitman  is committed to building coalitions in leadership for community health in the San Joaquin Valley and to really highlighting the air pollution burdens on valley children, seniors, and disadvantaged communities through his research and educational efforts.",0.0
False,,"Since his appointment to the board, he's already demonstrated his commitment to disadvantage communities by meeting regularly with community members to hear concerns, formulate solutions, and to bring a high-level of analysis of the community impacts to the board decisions.",0.0
False,,"Given the severe nature of air pollution challenges facing valley residents, Dr. Capitman's experience, expertise, and dedication are vital to leading the value to a prosperous and cleaner future.  So, we urge you to support this nomination and thank you Dr. Capitman for your service. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Jennifer Kuhn Leg Analyst, our understanding is that the U.C.  budget has become quite interesting, because on the one hand the Governor is expressing concern about their costs; about the cost per degree, there part cost per completion that cost per student. At the same time providing some money for the cost to go up without enrollment growth. So, it's just an  even higher spending per degree, higher spending per student.",0.0
False,,"So, I think this is just trying to foster a conversation; let's be comfortable as a state, as a University that whatever costs are generated are important enough that folks are willing to share in the funding of them. And again, it's just within this broader context of if there is a concern with costs at U.C.'s let's sort of try to address it coherently as opposed to in pieces.",0.0

False,,"I don't think any CBO would tell you that their LCAP in the first-year was perfect. I've seen some things myself that have made me slap my forehead, and, but I think that they want to get better. And I think that our organization wants to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem.",0.0

False,,"Good afternoon, Steve Cruz on behalf of The California Building Industry, so first I want to start with the thank you for the bond is critical to the housing and development so your work and craft of the bond, and delivery, I think it was a hundred eighteen votes in support was very impressive, so now as you move to implementation I would echo comments made about today about moving officially and deliberately of course through the process as you know for housing development. We have to plan a twenty-year horizon as a result of the show me the water laws, so projects that are before local councils and local governments today have to demonstrate dedicated funding source for those projects twenty years out so the faster that you move, the faster that less projects are threatened at the local level and they're all important us.",0.0
False,,"Senator Nielsen mentioned surface storage, that's certainly critical for ground water storage, but recycle water, conservation, home builders have come a long way in making homes more efficient so that's an important component to it, desalination, all those things are very important, the last thing I would say, sort of guard against, you know, rewriting the bond in ways that aren't consistent with the will of that the legislature, the voters, and I think that's important, and really want to continue to work with this committee, and would love an opportunity to come at a later date if you think that's important to have a further input, so thank you again.",0.0

That's where we are today. We need leadership.",0.0
False,,"We need a different solution, a paradigm shift in thinking. We're hopeful that this gentleman will be allowed to explore that, but if not, we absolutely need the legislature to bring the heat to make that happen. Thank you very much.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.",0.0
False,,"AHF is the largest medical care provider, private provider, in the world for people with HIV and AIDS, about 380,000 patients worldwide, 16,000 patients here in our home state of California. This is a huge issue. We appreciate the Governor and the department recognize the importance of it and carving out a certain amount of money to help close the gap.",0.0
False,,"The problem though, is not making sure that we have the money. The problem is making sure that drug prices are fair and rational and work well within the construct of our state budget. We need to make changes in how we fund drug prices, not putting in 300 million dollars for this and 300 million dollars for that. Mr. Chiu, we appreciate your taking a leadership role.",0.0
False,,"For those who don't know, Mr. Chiu has introduced a bill, I think as of today, that begins the process of trying to get the drug prices under control. The last thing I'd like to point out is, this is not just a hep C issue. While hep C is important to AHF because it's often a comorbidity of people with HIV, anti-retro-virals for people with HIV have been a huge problem in terms of pricing, for more than a decade.",0.0
False,,"And we've been trying to get those prices under control. The department has work to do that as well. We've had some success, but not nearly as much success as we need to get this whole issue under control. We encourage the legislature to really aggressively take on this issue from a policy standpoint as much as from a budget standpoint. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and members, Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We're very interested in this 300 million dollar set-aside for one hepatitis C therapy, which there's no dispute. The importance of these new therapies on medical treatment.",0.0
False,,"And, we're also very interested in the role that  our member health plans can play in the worker process down the line as it's fully developed. So while we're encouraged that the administration is taking this very seriously, it is very worrisome from our perspective that the state even has to set aside this large amount of funding just for one particular drug.",0.0
False,,"Particularly, since the pricing of these drugs is somewhat of a mystery. A few weeks ago, in the Senate Health Committee, the representative for one of the manufactures stated in committee that they do not base their pricing for these drugs on the cost of development, which we find to be very curious.",0.0
False,,"So, from our perspective the 300 million dollar set-aside may not truly reflect on the entire cost to the state as has been discussed. Some of our MediCal managed care plans are still working with the state to receive other supplemental kick payment for hepatitis C drugs.",0.0
False,,"So, again the 300 million dollars may not entirely reflect that, and we have some questions in the department on that issue. Ultimately, we are encouraged that the LAO be taking a second look at this at the time, and they may revise. It might do us good to ask the LAO or some other state entity to take a longer-term, longitudinal approach, I've always wanted to say that word on the mic, with respect to the analysis.",0.0
False,,"It's very important, in 2015 it's expected that about 12 new blockbuster drugs will be entering the market, so how are we going to pay for these in public programs in the commercial market, and that's a huge concern for us. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you Mr. Chair and Members Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. While we don't have a formal written position on this particular proposal yet, we have supported similar proposals in the past. We do think the underlying value here is coordination and continuity of care in a logical enrollment process that is designed to reflect at least other aspects of the health care system. So, if this item is held open, we hope it's given fair consideration and some reflection, particularly since the department has gone a long way in limiting if you will the proposal, at least in comparison to proposals that have been offered in the past. So we hope that you will fairly consider it as it's held open thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Chairman Quirk, Chairwoman from the state senate. This is a very important hearing. What will happen today hopefully will start the discussion, but more important, start us looking at solutions and how we curb the amount of police abuse that are going on not only in California but in the nation. It is my hope that California becomes the example and the template for how you reduce police violence and brutality.",0.0
False,,"The alarming thing for me has always been as we look at our clock, that every 28 hours, an African-American male is killed by law enforcement. And that is an abysmal statistic that we have in this country.",0.0
False,,"But I also realize, talking to people like Connie Rice in Los Angeles, a civil rights lawyer who for years sued LAPD. In fact, she prides herself as suing, having more lawsuits against LAPD than anybody else.",0.0
False,,But she's now working within the Los Angeles Police Department with Chief Beck to come up with alternatives to how you solve this problem.,0.0

False,,"That we don't have all white male law enforcement agencies in this state or in this country. Because I believe they are the solution for how to stem what's going on, but also doing a paradigm shift in the way we police and the way we interact with the public.",0.0
False,,And so I want to thank Senator Hancock and Assembly Member Quirk for pulling together this committee. I'm looking forward to getting some input.,0.0

One, I want to know what information you would need to be able to produce that for this committee, what kind of resources you would need to implement that within DOJ,",0.0

False,,"But we also need to know, what do you need to do to compile the amount of information you need to give an effective reporting back to us, and how long would that take?",0.0
False,,"Maybe we can talk about this offline, because I don't want... I have people coming to my office that want to legislate it.",0.0
False,,"And if we can do it through the budget process, which would be quicker, faster, much more effective, I would like to do it that way.",0.0
False,,"Otherwise we'll be, you know, six months, eight months down the road through the legislative process and then it's gonna take you another probably year to get funding to get ramped up. Let's get all the way to the funding and ramped up part. You can come to my office, we can sit and I can give you the parameters of what everyone's looking for as far as use of force, and what we ultimately want to find, both on law enforcement side and on the public side.",0.0
False,,"- And thank you for your testimony. My question's just a little bit different. You're an African American male who's within the system that's dealing with your colleagues, your law enforcement officers. And I know there's a code of silence and I know there is this thing where you don't basically rat out another fellow officer.",0.0
False,,"How do you handle it when you know some of your fellow officers aren't behaving appropriately? You know inside of your heart you need to say something, you need to do something to stop that behavior because with one or two of you do something wrong, you're all painted with the same brush.",0.0
False,,"Heaven knows any elected official will tell you that. What that feels like. But how do you handle that, so that this distrust or even the rogue cops, they're doing things that are illegal or brutalizing the community. You know it. You know who they are. How do you personally handle that?",0.0

False,,"Yes, it's good to see you, Sheriff Christianson, and Deputy Sheriff Brown, just need to let you know that the Ceasefire One Program is something that we're gonna look at it budgets of five, I haven't told Assembly Member Lackey yet, but we're looking to hopefully fund it in the CalGRIP program. So I just gave him a heads up.",0.0
False,,"Well, it's the CalGRIP program, so hopefully it trickles down to the appropriate people. Actually my question is for Tingirides because I work with Connie Rice, and she mentioned you. Actually I have three questions. And two of them is just because I wanna verify whether or not it's an urban legend. Plus a lot of these stories don't get out.",0.0
False,,"Especially the good stories with LAPD and I would like for you to repeat it, not only here for us in the committee, but also for everyone in the audience, that when you change the way you police, you get some unintended consequences that could be very very good.",0.0
False,,"And so I just need to verify, one, well it's about Christopher Dornan, and when he went on his crazy rampage against officers, it's my understanding he was going to try to go and kill a former Captain that he used to have, and he was going after them, and the Bounty Hunter Crips gang, which is your natural adversary within the Nickerson Projects, I believe they wanted to help.",0.0

False,,"And then my third question, you need to verify whether or not these stories, or at least give me the straight poop of what really happened. And then the third thing is, Connie talked about funding, Connie Rice, getting it off the ground, ensuring that the officers are there for five years, so that there's some continuity.",0.0
False,,"Looking at the way you do policing in a different way, giving you incentives for doing keeping people off the street, getting kids out of gangs, and that's how you get paid, and that's how you get your ""atta boys"" by doing that more so.",0.0
False,,"But where are you now? As far as, that was five years, you started in 2011, we're here now, will you continue to be funded, do we need to worry about whether or not this program starts to wane after so many years?",0.0

False,,Miss Weber was first.,0.0
False,,"Afternoon, Rosa Aqeel with Pico, California. I just wanted to make a couple observations. First, I think it's really unfortunate that all of the law enforcement officers have left. I think that if those are the good guys, then that's really, really concerning. I would hope that they would wanna hear what the community has to say, especially given that most of the folks that are speaking are folks of color.",0.0

False,,And it builds the chasm that exists already between communities of color and law enforcement. So I think that we have to be really thoughtful about what that's really saying.,0.0
False,,"Because if those really are the good guys and not even the good guys will say that black lives matter, that people of color matter, that there are things that are messed up in existing practices, then how are we ever to trust them?

False,,"This is when I put my budget hat on.

This is your first meeting of budget so far.",0.0

False,,Mr Rodriguez is a veteran too. Did you did you wait to make your opening statements? Okay.,0.0
False,,And I welcome everyone here to our first meeting as we look at the budget.,0.0
False,,"There's several issues and items that we want to obviously look at. Last year I think we did a phenomenal job in looking at recidivism and really really tackling it. Taking the bull by the horn and starting to, taking the CDCR we have corrections and rehabilitation. The r in rehabilitation for a long-time had been small r,  and we made it to a medium-size and are trying to get to a big r again. And with the help of Secretary beard, who has been phenomenal in and, working with us to bring that back into the system. I think we all believe if we do this right, rehabilitation.",0.0
False,,"We can reach almost all of our goals. Whether it's the number of. Reducing the size of a prison which or as a Governor told me ""we should be ashamed of the number of people we incarcerate in California."" and, I agree with him. As a as a society that believes in forgiveness but most important, a society that believes in second chances we need to be better at that.",0.0
False,,"And if individuals who are incarcerated that can fall within those rules we should be able to provide them steps to get there. Unfortunately in a society like this, we will always have to have room for individuals who do not want to participate in this society in a lawful same way.

False,,"So as we start looking through the budget, ways that we can financially promote all of those goals that we talk about every day. I'm hoping that we take that next step to realizing that.

False,,"The fact that we're there, it's just a different. I mean in a lot of ways it's taken us by shock. So, I'm trying to agree that we need to probably come together and try to think of some ways that we can gauge this.

The court ordered population reduction, have you thought about any long-term plan for how we're going to maintain compliance with the with the court order? Or how we could make it go away?

But we can at least begin that conversation and drill down to exactly what you're talking about and start shopping around and see if it's something that we can obviously legislate.",0.0
False,,"But most important, like you said, we begin to show that, it sounds like you want us to self-regulate ourselves and show the three court judge that we're serious about reducing the number. And not only are we serious, we're going to show you in our legislation or in our budget.",0.0

This whole thing about trying to provide long-term population projections or trends, I would like to have something in place when we meet again to talk about this, when we reschedule this, that we can all agree on.

We have to kind of do a complete turnaround on how we deal with this, and I like the fact that sector (inaudible) is the first to say, once we close prison, we truly save money; so I think we're all on the same page we just need to figure out how to get there.",0.0

False,,"But, I would like to get and for the Committee, we spent five-point-one million on this, and is your way. We can kind of get how that money was dispersed and expenditures,   which you spent it on, for example I think the first program may have gotten dogs out of shelters or sickly dogs for free,  and now these dogs are worth about five thousand dollars a piece, so what makes these dogs so much better than the five thousand-dollar dogs or is that all up in training them and just kind of getting the idea of where we're going and how we're proceeding.",0.0

False,,"Jennifer Kuhn from the Legislative Analyst's Office, and we released our higher ed analysis last week. I was gonna speak directly from the report. Thought I'd spend just a minute on some overview topics, but then dive to performance, which the legislature has indicated it would like to embed as part of budget deliberations, and then make some very high level comments on enrollment, operations, facilities, and costs of sharing, very quickly because I know that you'll be talking about these issues in more depth as you move forward.",0.0
False,,"Starting on page 12 of the report, it shows core funding for each of the segments, focused then on both state general fund as well as tuition revenue, so this is figure five on page 12. And just starting at the top you can see that for UC their budget total core funding again, state general fund and student tuition revenue, 6.3 billion.",0.0
False,,"Under the governor's proposal he's increasing it the 140 million, a 2% increase. This is what you've been hearing earlier today. All of the increase is coming from the state. For CSU you can see their total core funding budget of 5.4 billion, the increase level 158 million. It's a 3% increase and again you can see it's all coming from the state general fund.",0.0
False,,"Just moving down to community colleges, their core funding budget. Again, less reliant on student fee revenue, more reliant on local property tax monies. Their core funds budget is 8.7 billion, an increase of 737 million year over year. Of that 737 million, 500 million is for adult education consortia.",0.0
False,,"So it's helping to fund the state's restructured adult education system. If you were to exclude that, although you wouldn't necessarily want to do that, funding adult education is part of what community colleges do. But without that the increase would be 3%.",0.0
False,,"On page 13 there's just a list of budget proposals. That's what you'll be working through systematically in the weeks to come. So talking about, over the last few years the legislature has taken action to develop some performance measures to ask the segments to develop targets and then voiced an interest in using those budget reviews to inform its budget deliberations.",0.0
False,,"If you turn to page 15, it lifts the performance measures that the state has adopted. And what this particular figure shows is current performance in most cases, 2013-14, and the target in here it's just shown for 2017-18. For the sake of time I'm not going to go through every aspect of the table, but I think highlighting just a few things will illustrate a broader point.",0.0
False,,"If you look for example under graduation rates the four year rate for freshman entrances at UC, you can see that they're at 62%, they have a goal of getting to 66% by 2017. You can see for CSU their six year rate that they're at 53%, they have a plan to getting to 55%.",0.0
False,,"So these aren't necessarily their aspirational targets. What the state asked them to do is under the governor's plan, tell us what you plan to do, what you plan to achieve over this period. So as you can see they've planned to achieve some modest improvements in their graduation rates.",0.0
False,,"A key issue for you is, is this enough? Is moving from 53% to 55% between 2013 and 2017 sufficient progress? Going down in the table you can see funding per degree as well as units per degree. Two measures that are often looked at from an efficiency perspective, are students able to get out with fewer excess units?",0.0
False,,"Are they able to get out with less spending per degree? You can see at both UC and CSU from where they are right now to where they plan to be in 2017 increases in funding per degree, and no reduction in units per degree, or in excess units.",0.0
False,,"So again it might be something that you want to consider rather than just having the segments tell you what they plan to do, what is it that you would hope that they would achieve over this period of time, and is this improvement in this graduation rates and sort of lack of improvement in units per degree and funding per degree something that you think is acceptable, or something that you would like to participate in dialogue with the universities to see if you might want to set different targets?",0.0
False,,"Again, working collaboratively with them to figure out what is realistic with the resources at hand. On page 17, the state has, and the community college system has similar performance measures that are better tailored to the community college system. For example they have a completion rate somewhat comparable to a graduation rate.",0.0
False,,"This is for students who indicate they have a serious academic plan. How many of them within six years complete an associate's degree transfer complete enough courses to transfer. You can see it's 48% overall, and that their target is to improve by 1% of this rate. So for example to improve from 48% to 48.5% year over year. Again it's a very similar issue for you. Is this adequate? Or would you hope that these targets might be more ambitious?",0.0
False,,"You can see also on community colleges just turning a few pages in the report to page 20, that their six year completion rates have been slightly declining, even when you take or hear a broader perspective and you look back in time. So turning then from performance to the basic cost components of the universities and the community colleges budgets.",0.0
False,,"Starting with enrollment, there's been lots of conversation already today about enrollment. The governor for UC and CSU takes one approach which is not to have enrollment expectations, and his approach has been, well, I don't really want to do enrollment based budgeting for UC and CSU because this undermines a conversation about quality.",0.0
False,,"But then for community colleges he provides 2% enrollment growth, and he provides some money that's specifically for student support and success. So, we'd encourage you to take more of his approach for community colleges, which is not to have to choose between access and quality, but every year you're really focused on how to balance access and quality, just as he's doing with the community colleges we would recommend you do for UC and CSU.",0.0
False,,"That is, determining how much enrollment growth you want at each system, and then if there are extra endeavors you want to improve, student support, student success, you make targeted investments in those areas.",0.0
False,,"So to help you get your hands around, what is appropriate enrollment growth at each of the segments, we did what we normally do in terms of looking at the high school, public high school graduates, looking at the college age population in California, looking at the segment's admission data and trying to figure out what it tells us.",0.0
False,,"So demographically the college age population is declining between 2015 and 2016 it's going down about 1%. It's steadily declining, projected to over the next five years. So, when you look all the way out to 2020, the college age population 18 to 24 year olds is about 300 thousand individuals fewer than 2015.",0.0
False,,"So then we also looked at their admits and how many students they're turning away, and UC indicates that it's still admitting all eligible students, both freshman and transfers somewhere in the system. CSU indicates that it's not admitting all eligible transfer students.",0.0
False,,"When we look at their admits for freshmen, it does appear that they're still drawing from their master plan eligibility pool. When you look at their transfer students it's a little bit more complicated in that if they're turning away non-local transfer students, we're not sure there's a capacity issue, and that CSU is designed to serve local students.",0.0
False,,"So if the student had applied to their local campus and gotten in, then it's not clear there's a capacity issue. So, we've just been suggesting that you ask CSU for some finer grain details so that you could determine is there an access problem?",0.0
False,,"Is there a campus that's turning away eligible local transfer students and not accepting any non-local transfer students, such that they don't have capacity already existing if they just reorganized how they did their admits.",0.0
False,,"For community colleges, you've talked about this a little. In the current year they got 2% growth. I'm sorry, in the current year they got 2.75% growth. Based on their current enrollment they're coming in at about 2% growth. So, it's unlikely that they'll get all the way to 2.75 percent in the current year in 14-15.",0.0
False,,So it's something that you'll have more data on in May to try to figure out what you want to do both in the current year and the budget year. What happens in the current year will just happen automatically in terms of how much access they were actually able to provide.,0.0
False,,"If it's 2% in the current year it's likely that something like 2% in the budget year would be reasonable. So just some final comments on operations, facilities, and cost of education. If you turn to page 37, you'll see that right now the state is taking very different approaches on how specifically it's funding each of the higher education segments.",0.0
False,,"So you can see in some cases there's very few strings attached. For UC it's giving them 4%. As you've already talked about today this is creating some, I think, confusion and frustration because you're not quite sure what you're getting from the 4%.",0.0
False,,"Have you gotten enrollment growth or haven't you? Have you gotten just mandatory cost increases? Have you gotten retirement increases covered? As the state has traditionally done we continue to suggest you figure out what are your objectives, and then fund those objectives specifically.",0.0
False,,"If it's enrollment growth, if it's a COLA, if it's stat service increases, retirement, that the state, that you're specific about what you'd like. Even when it comes to base increases the governor has different approaches. For community colleges he funds a COLA, for UC, SCU he just provides the 4% not linked to a COLA.",0.0
False,,"So again, my main message here is just thinking about what you want to achieve. Is it purchasing power, holding it constant? Is it paying for retiree healthcare cost increases, pension increases? For that you go ahead and prescribe what you think are state priorities for the segments.",0.0
False,,"If you turn to page 56 and 57, it itemizes UC and CSU's capital outlay requests, and I just wanted to make two points here. One of the benefits of hearing capital outlay requests in the subcommittee, is that you have the unique advantage of being able to make sure your programmatic and your facility decisions are aligned.",0.0
False,,"So if you do fund enrollment growth, then if there are facility requests related to enrollment growth, you're able to consider those in tandem. There are a few UC requests that are driven based on program expansion, enrollment growth, and again you might want to revisit those after you've made some of your other decisions.",0.0
False,,"You might also find given that these lists can be daunting in terms of all the capital projects that come before you, that you might want some priorities. Do you want to fund life safety projects before program expansions? That could help you identify what you want to do within a segment as well as across the segments. And finally after you've made all these decisions, enrollment growth, operations, COLA, retiree healthcare, facilities, legislature often thinks about how it wants to share those costs.",0.0
False,,"If you turn to page, page 63, you can see that even today, even after the tuition increases that occurred during the recession, all three public segments have relatively low fees when you compare them either to their peer institutions or to other community college systems across the state.",0.0
False,,"And if you turn to page 71, you can see what happens in the state's experience with holding fees flat during economic recovery. Economic recovery is when students' families tend to be fairing better. Their families might be receiving COLAs, again doing generally better obviously than during the recession.",0.0
False,,"And you can see the steep increases in fees during recessions when families tend to be fairing worse. This is the state's experience, so what we've been encouraging the state to think about is after you decide what costs are essential that you think the system is required to both maintain access, to maintain quality, you think about who should bear the costs of those.",0.0
False,,"Should it be entirely the state, or should it be shared? Given the state has state and institutional financial aid programs this tends to be a conversation about should non-needy students, those that don't have financial needs by the way that these programs define them, should they bear any of the extra costs?",0.0
False,,"If their family is doing better, if the state is effectively funding a COLA for the system, should their family be asked to pay a portion of those costs that have been deemed essential for the system? So, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.",0.0
False,,"There's two. Riverside, and...",0.0
False,,You know my colleague might help me.,0.0
False,,"Yes, yes. Well, Paul Golaszewski will give you the right answer.",0.0
False,,"Yes, one can view the universities as, in some ways, when you compare them to all other state agencies in a somewhat advantaged position, because when the state general fund drops during a recession, they can raise raise fees, and given that fees are comparatively low across the country, they can raise them and students still are going to line up and consider it a rather good deal to be able to access the education.",0.0
False,,"Such that when the segments were seeing cuts in the state general fund, they were, to some degree, offset with tuition increases. In addition, if they were financially needy students, they were insulated, they weren't paying the fee increase.",0.0
False,,"That was being covered by the state in the form of Cal Grants. During the recession, tuition and Cal Grants more than doubled, so it was more of a distributional impact on those folks who weren't qualifying for aid, were paying the price. From an institution's perspective, they were a bit better off than some other agencies, because they had this alternative revenue to draw on.",0.0
False,,"When we looked at UC, and you put their student... Their state general fund and their student tuition revenue together, and you compare seven eight with '14 '15, it's down, as I recally, 5%. So, it is still down in per student terms.",0.0
False,,"But, we also looked at it somewhat differently, because UC can access some private money, and other sources of support, which they did increasingly during the recession. So, when you take a somewhat different perspective on how much they spent per student, they were spending a little bit more in '14 '15 than in seven eight.",0.0
False,,"It's sort of an indication of the health of the system. They were able to maintain their program, and actually spent a little bit more per student, post recession, than during the pre-recession years.",0.0
False,,"Yes, and we'd be happy to work with you, because when we do our share of cost numbers, we do count Cal Grants, and I think that we do it without double counting, there's clearly a way that it can be done. So, we'd be happy to work with you to make sure you're getting just the slice of information that you want.",0.0

False,,billion dollars is not spent on the CalWORKS program. It's spent on something else. That's partially why we have a big problem in California.,0.0
False,,"Contrary to the myth that, that family that the maximum family aid for family of two is 670, actually only thirty percent of the caseload",0.0

False,,"I think we've made our thoughts on this matter pretty well known over the years, repeatedly. Particularly on the issue of the timing of these notification, so I don't think we have anything to add at this point.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank you for convenience I should speak since I'm probably the problem child to get us all here today and let.me let me just state I didn't get here to have an audit just off a whim. There were some things were very troubling to me when I first got here and I'm very sensitive to the fact that there have been perceived budget cuts of a billion dollars or more to the court since 2008.",0.0
False,,"However, from my perspective being new here after two years, when I first got here I notice that the Legislature to Governor had pumped quite a bit of money into the courts. I've also assisted in the effort and even though the courts may say they are a billion dollars in a hole, or a billion dollars is being taken away from them.",0.0
False,,We can't forget they got five hundred to six hundred million in CCMS (court case management system). They got another hundred-million from the Legislature in 2013 and I might add in 2013 we gave them one hundred million in my district and they closed a court that helped women who were involved in sex trafficking get off the street.,0.0
False,,"They thought that was a priority to close that instead of trying to help young women who are being victimized in my district every day. We gave another two hundred million to 2014. In the report itself, it calls to question another 386 million in questionable spending, 30 million on cars cell phones and today The Governor has asked that we give the courts another 100 million.",0.0
False,,"From my perspective we've given the court 1.316 billion to 1.4 billion and they still reduce staffing, they still cut courts and they are still crying about another 1.7 billion that was redirected from the court construction funds to core operations and state general funds.",0.0
False,,"From my perspective, there's probably close to two billion dollars that have been pushed into the courts so the Real question is - What the hell did you do that money? What did you do to effectively manage the courts in a way that we did not have to close courts, people did not have to travel a hundred or more Miles to get access to justice?",0.0
False,,"So, as I looked at the core structure, as I sat with several members of my Committee and The auditor about what to audit, I wanted a more comprehensive audit. I wanted audit the construction funds to see if they're being managed properly because billions of dollars that may not be managed properly.",0.0
False,,"What I found is right now is right now The Judicial Court has what I call analysis paralysis. They lead by Committee.  You have a revenue and expenditures Subcommittee six trial court PJ's (presiding judges),",0.0

The Judicial Council has 21 voting members including Judiciary, Legislative and State bar participants Another 58 presiding judges and Trial Courts So the real question is - Who is in charge?",0.0
False,,"Like with The Legislature you have to have one person in charge whether that's a speaker, The Governor or The President pro tempore, you cannot lead by Committee. So I'm hoping that with new management that is coming in specifically with Martin Racino that as I try to work with the chief jar two years ago that we finally have someone in place who's going to actually make some critical evaluation of the entire department and come up with some constructive ways that we can move forward.",0.0
False,,"I love the thing that we did with the workload allocation funding model (WAFM) but I am still not comfortable that there's any accountability there seems to be relatively no oversight. And, there's no transparently.",0.0

False,,"So I am ecstatic about this audit. I'm happy to hear from the Auditor. I think they've done a remarkable job in the.limited scope that they have, and I'm looking forward to some ways that we can one get accountability, transparency and ultimately that this body can have some type of oversight on how the funds are being moved.",0.0
False,,I understand this whole concept of three branches of government but there's a larger branch of government that hangs over all three branches and that's the people. we manage the people's money and at the end of the day that's tho all three are answering too and we're just vessels for that. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"I have several, but I'll keep it down to a minimum because we have other testimony.",0.0
False,,"I agree with you that we need to work closely with the chief justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, and I apologize for another hyphenated last name person, if I put your name. And Martin Hushino. We need to work together with both of them to effect this change because my question is more of, who really is in charge over there at courts.",0.0
False,,"And I'm not blaming them, I'm blaming more the structure. When you go up through the structure, the presiding judges have a lot of authority. As I mentioned earlier with the closure of the David Kenyon Juvenile Justice system and center in my district, after we gave the local courts 26 million, the next day and immediately closed that.",0.0
False,,"And I know you made a comment, it's about a million dollars and all of the different moneys that are paid to high-level employees, but that could have kept that court open. So it's not just a little money, it's not just a little money to a lot of members here who may have smaller courts where that money could have kept their court open.",0.0
False,,"And so I agree with you that we do have a lot of committees in place there, but I used to be an administrator and I've gone through several audits, I even made an auditor cry one time and I know how to get through this, but also know how to wait it out until after the auditors are gone, the elected officials are gone, and we go back to business as usual, and so I'm really trying to come up with the with a way we can help the existing management there right now.",0.0
False,,"Put in place long-term, sustainable accountability measures, transparency measures, maybe it is auditing every once in a while, but my real question is, do you get a sense of if there's anyone truly in charge, I mean you talk about the Strategic Evaluation Committee report and that counsel coming with some brilliance, some excellent recommendations, but somebody's got to implement them, and if you have no one to implement them, no one to do the carrot and stick to ensure that it gets done in a timely manner, it'll never get done.",0.0
False,,"And I think that might be part of the problem, that there's probably an entrenched group of people within the system that are comfortable with status quo, and so if, one, did you ever get a sense that there's anyone who will actually take the bull by the horn and make these things happen, or is it the function of the different committees and things of that nature, very difficult to really drill down and make some significant changes.",0.0
False,,And if there's anything you could suggest to get us there.,0.0
False,,"Let me just say at the outset, Judge Marsha...is it ""slow'?",0.0
False,,"Sometimes I'm John-Sawyer, you know. But both of you have given me some comfort, a lot of comfort as your predecessors before you have come to me on a budget, and a court, Stephen Jarr, and others, gave me a measure of comfort that you two and the Chief Justice really, really want to make some significant changes.",0.0
False,,"And so I would look at us, the auditors office, the joint legislative Audit Committee, my Committee, as partners in this, and I know sometimes it seems a little difficult, but we're all family. Just think of it like a family argument and we're all family trying to move this along to get to a point where we all want to open up more courts and have more people have access to justice.",0.0
False,,"And if we just start focusing in on that, I think we will ultimately get there, and my question is one of those tools that I want to use or possibly use is this tool that we used today, which is the audit. And in some ways, I will agree, probably in a lot of ways, I will agree with Senator Roth about yes, the magnitude of the money may be very small, but for us it might be a microcosm of culture in the court system and that's really what we're getting to right now, today.",0.0
False,,"And hopefully we can work through that. But one of those tools is an audit, and if we worked, for example, and I'll just put that out there, if we were to also try to find some better ways that the local courts are managed, for example, if we were to find a small court, medium-size court, and the LA county court, that probably would be about 40% of the budget.",0.0
False,,"Which I think would be a significant amount of the budget that we could audit and come up with some ideas on how they can manage better, find some savings, and ultimately maybe find some money so that they can open up, or keep courts open.",0.0
False,,"And so in that respect, there's a discussion about whether or not we do annual audits or every 2 years. I'm more inclined to go every 2 years because I think that this one was done after 2 years and I think it was very important get done and we got a lot of great information that we can now use to help formulate a budget, hopefully help you manage your courts better, but how do you feel about the use of audits for you, so that you can better manage your operations, so the two of you can drill down and find things that, because you don't have to staff to go out there and independently look at things, you now have that as a tool for you.",0.0
False,,"So 1 year, 2 years, semi annual audits...Don't give me that audit face.",0.0
False,,"And, just real quick, I've reviewed the audits that have been done internally and they're watching in a lot of ways, and so I recommend you look at them.",0.0
False,,"And I look at audits a little bit differently and we're going to bring this within my Subcommittee, subcommittee five later on, to talk about this.",0.0
False,,"Audis aren't necessarily bad. If the Auditor comes and brings an audit to sub five that basically says you need to increase the budget by X amount, and the functions that this money needs to go is ABC and we get our buckets, that's a much stronger argument for us to legitimately give you money and we have an outside independent Auditor saying that you need money, you need money for these different categories, so I don't necessarily always look at it as a bad thing.",0.0
False,,"In some ways, I look at as a way to validate why you need money, and most important, how much you need, and how quickly you need it, so I wouldn't just get all negative and everything about audits, but this could be a great way to help the judicial system. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"I do want to thank you for allowing us to be on this dice today and most important, just to remind everybody, budget sub five will be looking at the audit and recommendations, and if we can maybe even use some budget language to institutionalize some of this so that we can move forward and ensure that accountability, access to justice, transparency, all those things that have been discussed today, we hopefully will be able to do it through the budget process.

False,,"We don't atempt to amend the bill to include the child exemption, I mean the the parent - the relative exemption that we had in last years bill. That one came out and this is the one piece bill - not a two piece bill okay.",0.0
False,,No absolutely not.,0.0
False,,"Thank you. Good afternoon and Thank you Chairman Beall and Chairman Wieckowski, senator and members of the Committee for having me and for accommodating my lovely ski accident that I'm recovering from.",0.0
False,,"I kind of forgot that I was not twenty and I was fifty eight. So, thank you for having me. I'm Catherine Reheis-Boyd and I represent the Western States Petroleum Association.",0.0
False,,"And our Association for those of you who are not familiar, hopefully you are, but we make-up the state's major oil producers and refineries that",0.0
False,,"are responsible for nearly one hundred percent of all the gasoline, diesel, jet fuel sold in the State of California.",0.0
False,,"So we have I think a unique perspective to bring today and, hopefully, a contribution to make to this discussion.",0.0
False,,And I'm so glad to hear that my friends at the auto industry also have some concerns to express today.,0.0
False,,"Our refiners, I think you know who they are, Chevron, Tesoro, Valero, Shell, Philips 66 and Exxon Mobil.",0.0
False,,They are the focus of many of the state's climate change policies. We certainly are in the stationary source of cap and trade we are in the transportation fuels under the cap and trade,0.0
False,,We're in the low carbon fuel standard. So we are and we have the honor of being in many buckets here in this conversation.,0.0
False,,"But, it's also really important to understand that at the same time we are holding the serious responsibility of supplying adequate reliable fuels to the marketplace.",0.0
False,,And I want to get into that a little bit. It requires us to do that every day 365 days a year.,0.0
False,,"I think, we've talked before about California's transportation fuel market being the third-largest feel market in the world, as a state.",0.0
False,,"And, the only two that are in front of us are the United States of America and China.",0.0
False,,"So, it's a large large market. Your constituents and our customers drive twenty six million cars and over one million medium and heavy-duty trucks.",0.0
False,,That requires thirteen billion gallons of gasoline three-point-five billion gallons of diesel every day.,0.0
False,,"And, that's as we sit here that's two million gallons of fuel every hour of every day.",0.0
False,,We say that just to put this into perspective when we talk about going towards 2020 and post 2020.,0.0
False,,"So the need for reliable transportation fuels in California is enormous and, the benefits for reliable mobility for families and businesses in this discussion is critical.",0.0
False,,"So, a primary concern for our refineries as we evaluate these proposals and these fuel policies is really the potential impact this has on fuels for the state.",0.0
False,,Now we recognize that the state certainly has the most aggressive climate change goals and they intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.,0.0
False,,that is not at debate and we don't question that. But as decision-makers I know you are appreciative of the mobility needs of the public and we have to consider these policies not only in,0.0
False,,their contribution to the state's climate change goals but also to their potential impacts on the fuel supplies.,0.0
False,,Obviously the state has deserved a reputation as a leader when it comes to innovative public policies. But when we look at the rest of the world and where they are going it,0.0
False,,"appears they are heavily relying and this is,a lot of what is being talked on the road Paris, is really policies that are relying on market mechanisms like the cap and trade program.",0.0
False,,That's what everybody's talking about. That's what's going to encourage reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.,0.0
False,,And not conversations on what we call here complementary policies that we think can be confusing costly and potentially contradictory like the low carbon fuel standard.,0.0
False,,I am in a bit of disagreement with my other peers at the table on this topic. Policies like the low carbon fuel standard attempt to set sector specific targets,0.0
False,,that really limit the flexibility to achieve the larger goals that we think not only California's after but the rest of the world is talking about.,0.0
False,,"So, if California wants others to follow its lead we think it's essential to increase the emphasis on the cost-effective marketplace policies rather than policies aimed at specific economic sectors of the economy.",0.0
False,,Now you've talked about today a suite of these regulatory programs that are already in place that are designed to aggressively force development and deployment of alternative fuels and technologies.,0.0
False,,As well as drive fundamental changes in land use. Most of these aggressive policies certainly are in the early stages of implementation.,0.0
False,,"So, there is obviously some uncertainty exists with the fuel supplies whether the manufacturers can actually do it or local governments can comply with it.",0.0
False,,But that being said achieving the necessary emission reductions in the transportation sector to meet the California's climate change goal,0.0
False,,really is focused right now on reducing vehicle travel in sb 375. You've got establishing this the fuel efficiency being talked about in the ARB's Advanced Clean Cars Program.,0.0
False,,The heavy-duty vehicle greenhouse gas regulations. You certainly are taking a very active role in deploying advanced technology vehicles that operate on electricity and hydrogen in the zero emission vehicle program.,0.0
False,,"Which obviously, we've discussed has its challenges but all of us were also there to support AB-8 and getting hydrogen stations being located in the state. Using alternative fuels is very prominent in these regulations.",0.0
False,,"You've got high-level ethanol blend, you've got natural gas from noble natural gas drop-in replacement fuels, renewal gasoline and diesel all of these are very very prominent in all of the existing regulations that we're talking about to achieve all of the goals that we are talking about.",0.0
False,,In addition as you all know as of January one 2015 fuels have been brought under the cap and trade program. And  so CARB's cap and trade program and now they're subject to a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions.,0.0
False,,So this cap is enforceable and it will ensure greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels do not exceed the amount permitted by CARB.,0.0
False,,So of the many policies we have in place today the purpose of meeting the California's climate goals some are intended to reduce the demand for petroleum fuels but others will negatively impact the supply of petroleum fuels.,0.0
False,,We're really making this clarification on focus policies that are on the demand side and not on the ones that can have a negative impacts on the supply-side.,0.0
False,,"So demand side policies we think are the preferred option to look at going forward. The improved vehicle efficiencies, the focus on land use planning including investments in public transportation.",0.0
False,,Those are more likely to meet the state's climate change goals without compromising the reliability of supply of transportation fuels for families and businesses throughout the state.,0.0
False,,So in contrast to the demand side policies there's a low carbon fuel standard this is a prime example of a supply-side policy it impacts the reliability of transportation fuels and we think it should be reevaluated.,0.0
False,,"It was adopted in 2007, it's half-way through its ten-year compliance period as the Committee's background paper notes the low carbon fuel standard requires a ten percent reduction in carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in California by 2020.",0.0
False,,"But that carbon intensity reduction as, you know, has been frozen at one percent since 2013. So, early in the impact of this regulation as we look to a ten percent as we come out of this freeze at one percent.",0.0
False,,"So in fact, the compliance with low carbon fuel standard is really by ethanol blending and most of the credit sixty percent of them are generated under the program from that.",0.0
False,,The ARB's compliance scenario for 2014 assumed that a hundred million gallons of low ci sugar cane from ethanol from Brazil would be available in the California marketplace.,0.0
False,,So they assumed a hundred-million gallons. In 2014 three million gallons were sold in California. So the program is not seeing at this point in time it's anticipated investments and subsequent commercial availability of these low CI fuels.,0.0
False,,Particularly as we all know in the cellulosic biofuel area. So we think this program on the supply-side it really does rely heavily on fuels and technologies that are not commercially available.,0.0
False,,"And therefore there potentially will have an impact on supply of conventional fuels to the public. Again, we really think the emphasis should be on the demand side policies that many of which have been discussed today in which we totally support.",0.0
False,,So we do encourage serious review of the low carbon fuel standard before 2017. We will be coming out of the one percent freeze in 2016 and the complies schedule is aggressive going forward.,0.0
False,,We really think that program needs to be looked at from as Chairman Beall noted from a cost-effectiveness standpoint where does it fall in when we look at and how close we are already meeting the fifty percent reduction goals.,0.0
False,,So in conclusion while the transportation sector certainly accounts for forty percent of the greenhouse gas emissions and we understand that has to be addressed.,0.0
False,,"There are numerous policies in place today in the cap and trade program, in transportation fuels under the cap and trade program to ensure we meet these goals. and we encourage you again to thoroughly review these existing programs.",0.0
False,,I kind of always like to know where I am before I decide where I'm going. So kind of really looking at where we are with the existing programs and then deciding what that path forward looks like.,0.0
False,,"Some you will find are performing well some are not performing as expected and some are expensive and inefficient. So we would resist a let's throw it all in the basket, let's do all of the above until we kind of look at a rank and see where we are and how close we are.",0.0
False,,And then what we need to do to fill the gap. We encourage again to incorporate evaluation of the policies on how they're impacting consumers and how consumers can be protected.,0.0
False,,There's a lot being done in the electricity and natural gas side of the cap and trade program to protect consumers and we think we need to look at our industry as well.,0.0
False,,"We also note from your questions on the coordination between Committees very happy that the CEC formed petroleum market Advisory Committee they've been having quite a few meetings,",0.0
False,,"and I encourage you to have them come in and talk to you also because they're looking at all of these fuel policies. And, they have indicated they want additional resources to delve into the examination of the impact of climate policies on fuel markets and consumers.",0.0
False,,a great wonderful of the input CRM.,0.0
False,,"That I think will be a very good discussion. So, I would say going forward, and our members, be clear on the goals, focus on demand side policies many of which we've talked about.",0.0
False,,"Be sure that the existing and propose policies don't compromise the reliable supply of conventional fuels for the public. Because that, you know, those gallons are huge.",0.0
False,,"And if you are not prepared to replace them, the program will be set back and that's not what anybody wants to have happen.",0.0
False,,"so make sure the agencies are coordinating. It's very important that everybody's in alignment on the policy and strategic goals that have been mentioned and,",0.0
False,,"again, we just we need to rely on petroleum fuels for a very significant part of the transportation future that's going to be with us for a very long-time far longer than any of these horizons we're talking about here.",0.0
False,,So let's just make sure we bring some more realistic expectations to the conversation as we figure out what we're going to go post 2020. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Good morning Chair and Members. Caliph Assagai on behalf of the California Public Defenders Association. We did submit an opposed letter to the Committee.,0.0
False,,"We've since met with the office and have an agreement to work out our issue, which has to do with identifying which warrant should be considered the original.",0.0
False,,"We're sure we'll come to a resolution, but I just want to acknowledge that we did oppose and we have worked with the author to address our issues. Thank You.",0.0
False,,Caliph Assagai with the California Public Defenders Association in support.,0.0
False,,Caliph Assagai with the California Public Defenders Association we were opposed to this measure based on a jurisdiction issue that has since been resolved with Judicial Council and Assembly Member Obernolte. We appreciate your willingness to work with us and we're no longer opposed.,0.0
False,,"Caliph Assagai with the California Public Defenders Association we are opposed this measure. This can already be charged as a misdemeanor, and we don't think they'll be a deterrent effect by increasing it to a felony.",0.0
False,,"Furthermore, these are the petitions already filed under penalty of perjury. So while we understand what the Assembly woman is trying to accomplish with this, we don't think it adds anything to this area of law. So we're opposed.",0.0
False,,"And that we're working towards better coordination pathway development for students. Thank you, you'll be hearing from a number of our folks, today's their ledge day here at the Capitol, as they'll be wearing those blue buttons as supporting K-12 adult education. So, appreciate the time. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Good morning members, I'm Lizette Everett, on behalf the Community College League of California. I want to thank if your time, and also thank the Governor for allocating $500 million to adult education. We do have a couple of concerns moving forward, one of them being the incorporation of the coming college non-credit funds into the Adult Education Block Grant.",0.0
False,,"These, aforementioned earlier by Donna Burns, these are planes that go into the education of both non-credit and credit in terms of integrated learning. The other is the concern of the lack of a data interface, a state-wide one. As you heard from many students, they don't care who's providing their adult education, they care that they can transition to both, and they can move on into the workforce or careers, and that's really important in a system moving forward.",0.0
False,,"Lastly, as you'll see from a lot of organizations here, there's a coalition really pushing that we have local consortium accountability plans that are--allow for really the analysis of needs, but also really take into consideration the dynamics of working together and  building on that existing collaboration. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Good morning, yes still morning. Judy Heimen, Legislative Analyst's office. The sergeant has distributed a handout that covers both of these next two items on your agenda I'll provide some brief background on Career Pathways Program, followed by our analysis and recommendations.",0.0
False,,"The purpose of this program is to improve career pathways which are sequences of courses in programs often beginning with career exploration in middle school, continuing with courses in high school that combine rigorous academics along with career preparation.",0.0
False,,"The courses are articulated with local community colleges and four-year institutions and the pathway process typically involves regional employers, labor organizations and other stakeholders to make sure that students are prepared for the work force.",0.0
False,,"The states CTE Pathways Program provides grants to consortia that must include at least one community college and one school district working together to help regions develop not just the pathways themselves, but also policies and collaborations that will support these pathways.",0.0
False,,The current program replaced an earlier version that ran from 2005 to 2013 and provided nearly four hundred million dollars over that eight-year period. The new program was funded in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 at forty-eight million dollars each and is scheduled to sunset June 30th of this year.,0.0
False,,"Yes, this is the last year and the Department of Education and the Chancellors office jointly allocate funding to projects and just to give you an idea of some of the types of projects that they fund, one grant is to continue developing model CTE course lessons that are posted on a website for sharing curricula among providers.",0.0
False,,"Another grant is for developing internship and other work-based learning opportunities for students and a third is to provide professional development on best practices for CTE providers. As Mr. Nuzam explained, the Governor's proposing to extend the grant program for an additional year and our assessment of that proposal begins on page four.",0.0
False,,"As my colleague discussed in the last panel, providing additional categorical funding for CTE further fragments the states workforce funding. The state school funding approach and increasingly it's approach to post-secondary education, relies more on accountability for outcomes rather than dedicated funding that's tied to specific activities.",0.0
False,,Extending a categorical program beyond statutory sunset would be a step in the opposite direction and for that reason we recommend that you reject the Governor's proposal to extend this program for an additional year.,0.0

False,,Could you repeat that? I apologize.,0.0
False,,"You stated that, evidently there's a difference between an ocean lifeguard and a sworn ocean lifeguard, and one I want to know about training for ocean lifeguards period: what's involved, and what is what is the difference between the two?",0.0
False,,"It's the opinion of PORAC, Assembly Member, that, well... I couldn't sit here and protest to you that I know the difference because I'm not a lifeguard or a fireman,  I'm a police officer in the State of California.",0.0
False,,The award was specifically developed for sworn peace officers and sworn firefighters.,0.0
False,,"We do, within PORAC, have many organizations that have fire, firefighters as well as lifeguards that are actually firefighters, or that are actually peace officers that their job assignment, their collateral duty assignment at this time, is a lifeguard. They're sworn peace officers, so they are currently eligible if they're sworn.",0.0
False,,I'd like to make a motion to move AB832.,0.0
False,,"Wasn't a question, I was going to move the bill, so I move the bill with the additional provisal that I will work with the author of the bill to find innovative ways to find funding.",0.0
False,,"And in fact anything that we propose that produces any kind of unforeseen economic problem to any entity, I think that the state basically is on the hook for it anyway, and so as it moves out, and your biggest challenge may be getting it out of Aprops, but I will work with you and the Chair of the Committee that handles that, so we can possibly  find a funding source, so it doesn't die an untimely death in Appropriations somewhere.",0.0
False,,"And I'd like to move the bill, I want to thank Mr. Stone for bringing this forward,",0.0
False,,"and I know you and I've been working on this for, ever since we got to the Assembly. We've had this carrot and stick approach to prisons and we use more stick than carrot, and I think at some point we've got to provide avenues in which people are allowed to improve their lives, and learn different habits than they have with the stick approach.",0.0
False,,"When I see this gentleman who sits in front of me, who's out of prison, and has not been in prison for several years, yes I see a man, I see someone that's turned his life around, but as someone who's part of budget, and the Chair of Budget Sub 5, I also see some someone that's not a cost or burden to the state to fifty thousand-dollars a year.",0.0
False,,"Which means he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the general fund, hundreds of million of dollars that can go back to programming for other people who want to get out, but most important that probably will exceed what we need, and we can also use that for schools, for roads, and other things,",0.0
False,,"and so this approach of allowing people to retrain them, to learn different habits through the various programs, I applaud you on that, and I'm going to, obviously, I put in the motion, but I'm also going to vote for this today and in hope that we continue this venue.",0.0
False,,"I've always said: out of a hundred and thirty thousand prisoners, people who are incarcerated, if we just took about twenty-two hundred of them, at fifty thousand dollars a year, we could save the state about eleven billion dollars over a ten year period, and we should really start thinking in those terms about the number of people who don't recidivate how much money we can bring back to our state coffers. So I applaud you on this effort.",0.0
False,,"I will take them in numerical order, starting with AB 672, the Inmate Reentry Assistance.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members. AB 672 requires CDCR to provide transitional services to wrongfully convicted individuals upon their release from prison. Over the last two decades, the number of exonerated in the United States has nearly tripled every year.",0.0
False,,"After spending decades in prison for crimes they didn't commit, wrongfully committed convicted persons are released back into the community without access to basic transitional services such as housing assistance, job training, or drug rehabilitation.",0.0
False,,"Simply put, this bill will provide access to the same services that parollees are able to receive upon release from custody. Here today to testify in support is Obie Anthony and Ignacio Hernandez, who is representing the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice.",0.0
False,,"In 2011, Mr. Anthony, after being wrongfully convicted, was released from detention after spending seventeen years in prison. Mr. Anthony was the inspiration of this bill. He was released from prison with nothing but his clothes and a few dollars in his pocket. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.",0.0
False,,The Earned Compliance Credit and Reinvestment.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chairman and members, Assembly Bill 926 creates an earned compliance credit report program that provides eligible parolees with the opportunity to reduce the length of their parole upon compliance with their parole conditions.",0.0
False,,Savings from the reduced parole supervision shall be re- invested into job training and housing for state parolees to reduce recidivism.,0.0

False,,"The number of people that are returned to prison significantly drops thereafter with 19.3% recidivating  in the second year and only 6.6% in the third year. if a greater proportion of resources were concentrated in the first year parole supervision, when parolees are most vulnerable to recidivate, the state could more efficiently utilize scarce resources, while helping to reduce recidivism and overall prison spending.",0.0
False,,"I ask for your ""Aye"" vote.",0.0
False,,"With me today is Jennifer, I don't have a Jennifer, okay, with me I have Glenn, not Jennifer Kim from the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, and Darris Young, a former parolee.",0.0
False,,That is correct.,0.0
False,,"Rosa Aqeel, PICO California, a proud sponsor, in support of the bill.",0.0
False,,"Okay I'll have Glenn, but, I just wanted to quickly say, the real premise of this and, when we talk about supervision, the way we've been doing it now, 74% of people recidivate, so obviously to continue to go down the path to the way we're doing now is not working and we need to provide funding.",0.0
False,,"What really got me inspired to do this is to get funding to create a different path or pathway for people to reduce their amount time in prison but also gain some skills using the funding that I've been saying all along since I've been in the Legislature that we need to help people get out reduce the time that they're in prison and then use that money as savings to create a system where they can get drug rehabilitation, get education, and I think this methodology that we're using now will ultimately create a different methodology for supervision.",0.0
False,,It's not about just incarcerating and holding people in jail and then waiting until the time when they get out.,0.0
False,,"If we continue down that path, we're never going to change.",0.0
False,,So what this bill does is start us in doing things completely different than the way we've done before.,0.0

False,,We support the Governor's goals of achieving fifty percent renewables and the broader meeting our 2030 GHT goals and establishing them and meeting them.,0.0
False,,Southern California Edison will achieve 33% renewable energy by 2020 and we can support a broader framework for achieving the 2030 goals. One that looks at integrating renewable energy--much more renewable energy--with energy efficiency and transportation electrification.,0.0
False,,We think that with regard to meeting the and exceeding the state's twenty-three goals going forward and going toward 2050 much more renewable energy is required but we really need to look at all of the tools in the toolbox.,0.0
False,,Utility discoverable renewables are important but distributed generation is equally important as is getting the utility significantly invested in the transportation electrification.,0.0

False,,We know that higher education is the best investment any of us can make in the State of California. We know that right now we there are more people desiring of a higher of higher education then we currently have space for in our CSU and UC system.,0.0
False,,"We all know the impacts that have been going on. While the state has been any huge budget crisis and we've had a cut back, we know that's going to change.",0.0
False,,"That is changing and, we this bill serves to be ready when the economy comes back fully and we're ready to find a new CSU that we have the actual data of where the greatest needs are in order to be able to use our money most effectively.",0.0
False,,So since defending of the California post-secondary education Commission in two thousand eleven we have not had a coordinating body to be able to do this type of work.,0.0
False,,So without having that coordinating body we don't have good concrete data from which to make our decisions. We know that we're going to have at least in two thousand and fifteen forty-one percent of California should have a higher education college degree.,0.0
False,,To be able to obtain the kinds of jobs that will be available and right now they only have about thirty five million. We have at least a million shortfall right now and that is going to continue to grow especially as a population continues to grow.,0.0
False,,So this simple task directs the LAO to conduct a state-wide analysis of the needs for a new CSU. The analysis will look at enrollment demands based on a five to ten year projections of the college-age population and public high school graduates.,0.0

Her grandmother who had been educated for sixteen years told not to do that, you need to go in higher Ed, go to private-sector where you could you be University President and swap more and make seven million dollars in benefits and things that nature.

False,,"But I chose public service like many of us around here and I'm concerned about the privatization of the UC and CSU and the Community College Systems; that we're looking at money, that's the number one factor in how we move forward, the fact that there's a very small group of individuals that make decisions on the budget they're making over five hundred-thousand-dollars that may be more connected to the state budget, than they are with anything else.",0.0
False,,"They're the ones that I'm really concerned with, and how do you change that behavior. You have individuals right now who are very similar to what I'm dealing with the judiciary. There's a small group of individuals in the AOC who make more than Governor, but they make one hundred-percent of the budget decisions that go on, and we find it a lot of the decisions were not in the best interest of the people, and people access to justice, but more important they weren't looking at how to do efficiencies in a way where they didn't need all the money that they claim to need, which is like one-point-two billion dollars. They probably need a whole lot less if they were a little more efficient, but they didn't care in some cases, they didn't care about how to do that in an efficient manner.",0.0
False,,"Right now, you have a game we're going with the UCs, with the people who are making this kind of capital. Where out-of-state students are on a premium for going out of systems, you can pay a premium or more important the students here. if I were them, if they wanted to really be a business enterprise, I would not have said we're going to cap out-of-state students to pay a whole lot of money at two thousand, and keep the in-state-students at one thousand. I would have made a great deal with the money that we would have made off of that, that brought that number to two thousand and anybody, you, me, and everybody in the Assembly and the Senate jumping up and down but instead, we're playing the pun games with people who make this kind of salary on the tuition, on the employees within the system, tuition hikes gone back as a pawn between this body and the UC and they just, like the judiciary say, almost act like we're almost like the third branch of government and the Assembly and others can't tell us.",0.0
False,,"One way we can actually impact this is through the budget, so I applaud you for coming at it through the pocketbook because that is a lot of ways to only you can make people perk up, and then like the lasting that really bothers me is when, and I'm not trying to put UCLA on blast right now, because obviously as I told my colleague from UCLA I would love to make sure UCLA football coach only made a hundred-thousand-dollars a year.",0.0
False,,"And then you would only be able to get a high school coach-to-coach and but that's a whole of the discussion, but the number of African-American students that are being admitted right now into the UC's is abysmal, and I don't feel, there's right now that, there's a real concerted effort to do that. Yes, the UC spent twenty million dollars a year to get minority students into the system, there has been another five million to go international, but, but they are able to be more successful with the five million than with the twenty. That's management, those are the people that are making all these, the people who make the decisions and they're not doing things. I think we're in a best interests, so I think this effort you're doing now looking at the perks, compensations, retirement, housing, employer paid compensation will probably shed a light because I call this the Marie Antoinette kind of analogy, where people at the top who make the decision cannot have this attitude to let them eat cake in hope that they ultimately will get what they want.",0.0
False,,"Whether not doing it a hundred-million or any, before we give the UC any money we need to make sure that they're using the money properly to do what the people of California really want done, so I'm one of those they're very cautious sitting on budget, the Budget Committee about how we move forward from this day forward, so I applaud you on this, I was still a little skeptical because I'm still unsure whether or not they will get the message before that you see for wake up and understand that the Assembly, the Senate, and the Governor very serious about that. Everyone has access to an education here in California and that should be the number one thing that we should be doing, not talking about compensations, deferred payment, houses, drivers and mansions in different place.",0.0

False,,"Madame Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association Advocates. I do want to point out in a way, this is friendly opposition, because Senator Hill has been very gracious to spend a lot of time with us talking about this issue.",0.0
False,,"It's unfortunate that we still remain opposed to the bill. And it's for two very practical reasons. First, I do want to point out that Senator Hill has actually done a bang-up job in his district, in making it clear to his school board, San Mateo Unified, and the people in his community, that he doesn't think that they handled this situation in the best manner possible.",0.0
False,,"And we've always thought, since this issue was first brought to us last fall, that this is an issue best handled at the local level. As we've seen before in other bills where we have a discrete problem in a small area, fixing it with a state-wide fix creates complications in other parts of the state.",0.0
False,,"So on one hand, one example is that different school districts handled the Prop 39 decision about an offer differently. Oakland Unified handles it much like San Mateo, which is, staff makes the presentation to the board, and the board acts on it as San Mateo did.",0.0
False,,"Los Angeles Unified, because they have so many Prop 39 requests, has made a point to shift the responsibility to the superintendent. So the superintendent makes the offer, the board does not take action on that offer. And there's no requirement that they do.",0.0
False,,"And in Los Angeles, that's important, because they get 80 to 100 Prop 39 requests every year. Can you imagine an LAUSD school board meeting, as infrequently as they really happen, having to deal with eight or nine Prop 39 requests at every hearing? Those school board meetings would become Prop 39 meetings. There would be no time to do anything else.",0.0
False,,"The other issue that we have from our standpoint is: the law is very prescriptive, both in terms of the statute, the regulations, as well as case law that's devleoped over the last fourteen years. That prescriptive law limits the amount of discretion that a school district has relative to meeting the definition of ""reasonably equivalent.""",0.0
False,,"Having public hearings and public comment and all that leads the public to assume that there is something else that can be done. That there is discretion at the school board level about which location they can offer to a charter school. And that, in most cases, is just not the case because of the prescription of the law.",0.0
False,,"We don't want to create a situation where there are more upset people because they expect to get something out of a public hearing that they're not going to get, and we certainly don't want to turn LAUSD and other school districts into just a conveyor of Prop 39 requests.",0.0
False,,"And we do think that Senator Hill has been very effective and think that that effort should return to the district, and hopefully San Mateo will be more transparent in the process in the future. For these reasons, we have to oppose the bill. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to clarify two things real quick. One, this is very much an administrative process because it is, so much expertise is necessary to do this that you can't really leave it up to sort of a policy 30,000 foot-level debate.",0.0
False,,"And I do want to correct one thing the Senator said relative to discretion, it is actually the issue of discretion about the location that is, it's hard to have any discretion. When you're talking about number of classrooms, you're talking about square footage, you're talking about all the amenities of the facility in order to accommodate the students. There are very few places in most school districts that would meet the very specific requirements of the offer that has to be made under Proposition 39.",0.0
False,,"Yeah if I may, Madame Chair, Senator Pan, and I appreciate the question.",0.0
False,,"Absolutely, through the chair. What Senator Hill is describing is a discrete situation in his district. And yes there may have been options, but my understanding, and Ms. Kollman may be able to expand on this further 'cause she actually represented the charter school in that situation, Design Tech, is that the location of the school was something that needed to happen quickly, right away, so they could open the school and get things going.",0.0
False,,"The other options were not options that were available. The co-location at Mills High School was always intended to be temporary. And as we understand it, in the next school year, they are expected to be someplace else.",0.0
False,,"And everybody knew that going into it, that this was gonna be the case. But the options that Senator Hill is talking about were not available to the school district at the time that the school needed to be open. They couldn't wait another year or two for other location possibilities.",0.0
False,,"I mean, it does underscore the fact that every school district is different, every school district is gonna have a different set of circumstances, and unfortunately most of them are not gonna have options even a couple years down the road, because the facilities in the school district are very limited, especially in terms of meeting those very specific requirements for square footage and classroom and all that kinda stuff.",0.0
False,,"Madam chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the California Afterschool Coalition. I really appreciate the description of the program that Senator Hancock has given. Of course we agree that it's completely accurate. We do want to point out that this is a problem that flows from Proposition 49 which we are grateful for but has created a box that's been very hard for us to get out of.",0.0
False,,"That initiative had a dollar amount in it, 550 million dollars, which was great at the time but it has stayed at 550 million dollars since it was enacted in 2002. And there has been no increase in that amount of money. What it's created, plus the statutory requirements of the program, it's created a box that after school programs have difficulty getting out of in terms of their finances.",0.0
False,,And Senator Hancock has mentioned things like the two minimum wage increases. We also have the sick leave change in the law that was enacted last year that requires us to have at least three days of sick leave for each of our employees.,0.0
False,,"Those are all costs that are real costs to the program that we don't have the capacity to budget our way out of to reduce programs, to even raise revenue. So what we're seeking is just as an increase to the 550 million dollars that would accommodate the two minimum wage increases.",0.0
False,,We're not even asking for all the costs. The 17% increase in the CPIs since 2006 is cost of doing business that we have to accommodate and we have to find a way to budget but we're not asking for that. We simply want the two minimum wage increases.,0.0
False,,The reality is the programs are going to get squeezed out of existence if there is not a way of finding relief. We cannot cut ourselves out of it because every time you want to reduce a staff member you have to reduce 20 students.,0.0
False,,"And you're then losing the 20 students worth of ADA. So your revenue loss ends up exceeding whatever you're going to save by cutting a staff person. You cannot, because of the population we serve, ask for parents to pay a portion of the fee.",0.0
False,,82% of our programs are serving people of free and reduced lunch eligibility. That's a lot of families that can't afford $10 a week or any amount to help offset the cost. And we're also already providing by statute 33% in kind or other revenue coming from outside the state.,0.0
False,,"It's a real box that we've got to find our way out of. We know this is also a budget issue but the bill does carry an escalator for future years so we don't find ourselves in this position year in and year out and would allow the department of education to increase it according to the CPI in future years. We ask for your support, thank you.",0.0

False,,Part of the guidelines provided recommended coverage of all seven FDA-approved cessation medication when prescribed by a physician without prior authorization. The elimination of the prior authorization requirement removes an extra barrier in accessing timely treatment.,0.0
False,,The elimination of this requirement also acknowledges that the prescribing physician is capable and qualified in determining which of the FDA-approved drugs are most appropriate for their patient.,0.0
False,,"When trying to quit, it is essential that we remove as many barriers as possible to achieve greater success. By codifying these federal guidelines, ABA 1162 achieves this goal. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"All right, 11 against 1. I like those odds. Mr. Chairman, members, Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans.",0.0
False,,"Regrettably we do oppose, AB 1162. We believe this bill will increase costs to the state by requiring Medi-Cal managed care plans to pay for tobacco cessation drugs in a manner that, that is inconsistent with the Department of Health Care Services policy and sound medical management.",0.0
False,,"To be sure health plans strongly support the importance of aiding individuals in tobacco cessation, and we recognize a staggering economic impact in the human consequences of smoking.",0.0
False,,"That is why the department requires Medi-Cal plans to cover the panoply of tobacco cessation drugs, but with reasonable medical management such as prior authorization under certain circumstances.",0.0
False,,"Unfortunately we do have several concerns with the bill. Number one, the measure requires medical managed care plans to cover all cessation, medications approved by the FDA.",0.0
False,,"And correspondingly, eliminates prior authorization requirements for these drug treatments and this provision alone, we believe is bad public policy. Some tobacco cessation drugs are not safe for all people a very popular tobacco cessation drug, for instance, is known to cause a whole host of side effects including, including suicidal behavior.",0.0
False,,"It's a great drug for many people, but for some folks, it does not work and can be dangerous. Indeed, the FDA in 2013 linked this particular drug to over 500 suicides over a five year period.",0.0
False,,"As a result, some plans do put that particular drug on the prior authorization list. So when we analyze a bill like this we do have to ask ourselves whether my member plans are being asked to pay for the wrong care at the wrong time for the wrong people.",0.0
False,,And we believe this bill opens the door for that and therefore we have to object. We also object to the language that further delinks counseling from the tobacco cessation drugs.,0.0
False,,"My member plans believe that counseling sessions are an important part of tobacco cessation therapy, and can enhance pharmaceutical therapies and maximizes, maximize the chance of quitting.",0.0
False,,The data clearly shows that patients that receive assistance from a clinician are two to three times more likely to to quit smoking for at least five months or more.,0.0
False,,"So, plans in the commercial market or in public programs are expected to be good stewards of either premiums or state funds. There's no provision here requiring the Department of Health Care Service to adjust the reimbursement rate to health plans for the enhanced benefit.",0.0
False,,So while we do strongly support the intent of the bill we must vigorously defend the management of formularies if the cost of this benefit is to remain affordable to the state. So for those reasons we respectfully oppose the bill. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Mm-hm.,0.0
False,,Right.,0.0
False,,Yeah.,0.0
False,,"Well, thank you assembly member. We're not gonna be able to be supportive of a bill that moves, that eliminates prior authorization. Particularly for a drug category that has known harmful side effects.",0.0
False,,"In indeed the Department of Health Care Services policy letter on this issue which is the, instructs the medical managed care plans does require the coverage of all seven types of medications, but it says that only one has to be available without prior authorization.",0.0
False,,"I think that's in recognition to some of the issues that I addressed in my primary testimony. So, you know, my initial thought here is that if his author and his staff were willing to sit down and talk about conforming the bill to the DHCS policy letter, I think we could find some constructive things to talk about. That, that, that would be our preference.",0.0
False,,"If there was, if there was, conformity, that may or may not, that may address our concerns. Of course, I have to consult with my members.",0.0
False,,I have 43 member health plans.,0.0
False,,43. Got it. Yeah so yeah with the majority of which do participate in the medical program and are proud of that. That might be a place where we could at least start discussions. But at this point the bill does not conform to that guidance.,0.0
False,,"That is correct, yeah.",0.0
False,,It is currently being offered to the MediCal population. What this bill does is remove prior authorization from the delivery of those drugs.,0.0
False,,Yes it does.,0.0
False,,"Yeah, it, in, in, in, it, as... I stated in my testimony, there in, in particular there is one drug with, potential very harmful side effects that some plans do put on prior auth.",0.0
False,,"And that, that'll be deployed if you know, those side effects will be relative for that particular patient, but, but, yeah, it is something that is used in the private sector as well.",0.0
False,,"The Department of Healthcare Services requires the coverage of tobacco cessation drugs. The our issue is that it, it this is different than the policy that has been issued by the state and in, in, in a way that we think is harmful so.",0.0
False,,"Jeff Vaca, representing the California Association of School Business Officials in support.",0.0
False,,Sawait Seyoum Health Access California in support.,0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, Members, Nick Louizos, on behalf of California Association of Health Plans. We have an opposed position on the current version of the bill. We got the amendments like an hour before the hearing so we're still looking them over.",0.0
False,,We'll take a look at those amendments and let the author know whether our position has changed. Again the problem with the existing bill is similar to the bill that Mr.,0.0
False,,"Holden had before the committee in that it removes prior authorization allowance for Medi-Cal managed care plans, on a drug which is oftentimes prescribed for off label use, and that may not be appropriate for all patients.",0.0
False,,So we'll take a close look at the amendments if they change our position we'll let you know. Thank you.,0.0
False,,Amber King with the Association of California Healthcare Districts also in support.,0.0
False,,"Good afternoon. Adrian Shelton with the County Behavioral Director's Association. We also, sent a letter of concern to the office, office, to the committee.",0.0
False,,"The concerns that are, in your committee analysis as well, so we look forward to working with the sponsors and the authors as this moves forward.",0.0
False,,I just wanted to also say that CBHDA worked in collaboration with Senate Pro Temp Steinberg and Disability Rights of California in the last legislative session to make some much needed changes to LPS and,0.0
False,,"there was also a companion legislation SB 82, which provided capacity grants to counties for crisis services. So we also want to ensure that the committee knew about that, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. The rapidly escalating price of drugs is impacting premiums and share of cost for our enrollees.",0.0

False,,"Mr. Chair and members, Rand Martin on behalf of the Aids Healthcare Foundation, the largest provider, private provider of care and treatment of people with HIV and AIDS in the world, with 16,000 patients just here in California.",0.0
False,,We've been fighting this issue for more than a decade because of the high cost of drugs for people with HIV. This bill is long overdue and we urge your support today. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Yeah to you, to your comment similar to Member Chavez, I think one, one of the pieces of misinformation that is getting out there is that drug prices are not on the rise.",0.0
False,,"And you know, obviously as the payers in the health care system we are very concerned about cost increases in the system.",0.0
False,,"And we'll just say that, the Assemblymember, Assemblymember Chiu mentioned this is in his testimony, but if you look at the top 100 drugs by sales, in 2010, only 26% of those, were $10,000 a year, or per patient I should say.",0.0
False,,"Pardon me. In 2014, that's increased to 47% of those top 100 drugs. So they, they are on the rise. And, and indeed, in, in those four years that price increase and that category increase by 750%.",0.0
False,,"So so, so we are concerned about the trend. We are concerned the tu-, pipeline. There are about 11 or 12 drugs that are going to be introduced or approved I should say by the FDA, that are in the blockbuster category.",0.0
False,,"And then, based on a, an actually, an old analysis, this may be different now, the drugs are actually 14 percent of the premiu, the premium dollar, not 10.",0.0
False,,"I would, with your indulgence, Mr. Chair, I just have to would like to offer to come in and talk to Assemblymember Maienschein and Assemblywoman Waldron about our position on SB-46. I think there's some misinformation that's being delivered on that bill.",0.0
False,,"We opposed that bill because, the information that was provided by the plans, triggered a specific regulatory action, on the plans. It wasn't a pure transparency bill from our perspective.",0.0
False,,We removed our opposition to a follow up Leno bill when it was distilled down to a transparency bill between employer purchasers and labor trusts and the health plan.,0.0
False,,So I'd like to come in and talk to you more about that because I think that's a bit of a Jedi mind trick as part of this debate.,0.0
False,,"Nick Louizos, California Association of Health Plans in opposition.",0.0
False,,"Nick Louizos, California Association of Health Plans, opposed.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair Members, Rand Martin, on behalf of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation I appreciate the summary that that Mr. Nizarian has provided. He actually took half my testimony away from me, but one statistic I do want to point out was that he had not included, is the the fact that despite the fact that we believe that we, if you read the press, that we have control of this epidemic.",0.0
False,,"There are still 5,000 new infections in California alone every single year. That really does indicate that we are far from in control of this of this epidemic. And the reason we're not is because there are populations that are increasingly hard to get to.",0.0
False,,"AHF happens to be the largest provider, as I indicated in testimony on another bill, but we're also the largest tester in the state of California. We did 50,000 tests, last year. We did 3 million tests worldwide last year. So we know the experience, that testing provides.",0.0
False,,"And testing is the answer to controlling the epidemic. Research demonstrates that if people know that they're HIV positive they will change their behaviors and they will voluntarily access care and treatment. So if we can get people tested, if we can get them in to places where testing occurs, we know that will happen.",0.0
False,,We test in a lot of different places. We even have mobile vans that go out to Target shopping centres. And down the street from dance clubs at 3 o'clock in the morning. But the last major institution where testing is not routinely happening is the emergency department.,0.0
False,,"And we all know that emergency departments are melting pots when it comes to the types of clientele that attend an emergency department. We're very sympathetic to the burdens on, on emergency departments.",0.0
False,,"We've done everything we possibly can, short of dropping the bill altogether to try and, eliminate as much of the burden as we possibly can, so that it is a far more routine and far less burdensome, effort in the emergency department.",0.0
False,,"We think it's important to get ahead of this epidemic, we think this is a really good way of doing that, and we ask for your support.",0.0
False,,"And, and, and Mr. Waldron, I simply like to add that we, we've been very careful in this bill not to be prescriptive. We set the overarching policy. But it's up to the hospital to figure how best to do that. And I think that the first thing that they will do is make sure that the emergency is taken care of first. We're not telling them that they have to do anything in one order or another.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, if, if, if you don't mind.",0.0
False,,"I do want to point out. I appreciate the study, and the, and the study is helpful. The study is also in an environment in which HIV testin, testing is very, very prevalent. There's a lot of testing that goes on in San Francisco. So finding smaller numbers in San Francisco is not surprising.",0.0
False,,"The research, and the statistics that the department of public health has on HIV, indicate that some of the worst places are places that are less urban. The more rural areas, the other urban centers that are not in San Francisco or Los Angeles, are actually seeing higher numbers of people who are testing late for HIV.",0.0
False,,"They're already coming down with symptoms of AIDS before they even get an HIV test. And it's those populations that we really need to get to. And the other population is Mr. Ridley-Thomas has pointed out, even an urban center, center like Los Angeles, a lot of communities of color are at very high risk, are not engaged in healthcare. And they find the place to get all their healthcare is still in the emergency department. Very important to get to those people as well.",0.0
False,,"Sure. There's, there's always going to be a population that uses emergency rooms that does not have any coverage and we appreciate that. And I think that we can continue to work on that issue. There, there, Medi-Cal, Medicare and private health now cover HIV testing in the hospital emergency department.",0.0
False,,"There are funds available through the Office of AIDS to pay and through county health departments, to pay for testing for people who do not have coverage anywhere else. Those are funds that hospital emergency departments could take advantage of as well.",0.0
False,,"So we can continue to close that gap so that almost everybody who walks through can pay. And yeah, there are people who can be private pay as well. The te, the cost of the test is actually not that much. It's less than $40.",0.0
False,,"I'm not sure what the hospitals might add to that, but, but the cost of the test is actually pretty, pretty, pretty small for those, who, who could do private pay. I also wanna make one other point relative to the testing sensitivity. The, the, the h, rapid HIV test is 99.7%, sensitive, which means that 99.7% it's right.",0.0
False,,"So, yeah, there are false positives, but they are very, very small numbers. And, yes, that's why we do confirmatory testing, but very few w, confirmatory tests will change the outcome of the initial test result.",0.0
False,,Nick Louizos with the California Association of Health Plans. Latest version of the bill is an improvement over the first one. We also have a support if amended position and want to continue working with the author to further refine the bill and protect health plan enrollees. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"Chair members, Autumn Ogden with American Cancer Society and Cancer Action Network, also in support of this bill.",0.0
False,,Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and Members. Tim Shestak with the American Chemistry Council. Appreciate the opportunity to make a few comments in opposition.,0.0
False,,"We have, as we did on last year's bill, we have two fundamental policy concerns with the bill. That the proposed label, the actual language on the label, we believe makes unsubstantiated and unscientific conclusions about the health effects of all flame retardant chemicals.",0.0
False,,"There's no analysis being done of each chemical to determine how it's used, at what levels. Whether there's any sort of exposure and whether those exposures may end up being problematic to a consumer.",0.0
False,,"And secondly, we believe that the bill circumvents the states two existing chemical and product regulation laws that are already on the books. Prop 65 and the Safer Consumer Products Regulation currently being implemented by the Department of Toxic Substance Control.",0.0
False,,"First on Prop 65. The bill currently requires the label to include a general statement and I quote, ""The state has identified many 'flame retardants as being known to or strongly suspected 'of adversely impacting human health or the environment.""",0.0
False,,"As you may know, the Office of Environmental Health Hazards Assessments implement Prop 65 by establishing a list of chemicals that are known to cause cancer or reproductive harm. Chemicals are also listed on the basis of developmental toxicity.",0.0
False,,Specific product labels are only required if a product contains a listed chemical or consumer exposure would exceed a safe harbor level.,0.0
False,,"Yet, under Mr. Leno's bill that entire process is circumvented and require manufacturers to label their products regardless of what flame retardants might be used or whether the available scientific information would justify such an action.",0.0
False,,"In fact, it's our conclusion that under this bill a flame retardant chemical that may not even meet the criteria under Prop 65, or may not even be selected by DTSC as a priority chemical would be called out for special labeling requirements under this bill.",0.0
False,,"Second point on the Safer Consumer Products regulation. As many, well, I shouldn't say as many of you might know, that bill was passed in 2008, so some folks may not have been here at that time, but the legislature did pass a law authorizing DTSC to establish a process to identify, prioritize, and if necessary, evaluate chemicals of concern that might be used in consumer products.",0.0
False,,"At the same time, also evaluating potential alternatives. The current law provides DTSC with a broad array of options in terms of regulatory responses after the scientific evaluation is done. They can do nothing. They can impose use restrictions. They can impose labeling requirements.",0.0
False,,"So they run the gambit in terms of opportunities that they may be able to impose. Just last year the department has started this process. They've identified some chemicals in products, one of which is a flame retardant used in nap mats and again, it's our point that this bill is a preemption of the implementation of that law.",0.0
False,,And we should be at least that information ought to be and that analysis ought to be concluded before you require a broad labeling requirement on products that have not yet even be evaluated by DTSC.,0.0
False,,"A final point that I'll make is that just as there are a variety of different metals, industrial gases. There are a variety of different flame retardants. They're not all the same. Their chemistries are different. And I think it is important to point out that in our letter, U.S. EPA, and I'm happy to pass this out to the committee, concluded just in 2013,  and I'll quote,",0.0
False,,"""During it's review of data on flame 'retardant chemicals and (mumbles), EPA has also 'identified approximately 50 flame retardant chemicals 'that are unlikely to impose a risk to human health.""",0.0
False,,"Even under this bill, you would still be required to check a box yes or no as to whether or not your product contains those flame retardants and chemicals. If the proponents do believe that there are products that should be labeled, we believe there's a regulatory avenues in place for them to pursue that. And for those reasons, we urge the committee to hold this bill, thank you.",0.0
False,,"Mr. Chair, Madam Chair and members. Nick Louizos on behalf of the California Association of Health Plans. We respectfully oppose SB 671.",0.0
False,,"Members, from the paraperspective, the emergence of biosimilars or interchangeable biosimilars into the market is a welcome phenomenon. If unfettered, these products could offer substantial cost savings to the health system. Indeed, it is estimated that biosimilar competition for the 11-most popular biologics would save the US $250 billion on healthcare over a decade.",0.0
False,,"So for that reason, we are not inherently opposed to the idea of state law allowing a pathway for these drugs to enter the market, but it has to be an unhindered pathway. That is why we are opposed to bills like SB 671.",0.0
False,,"While well-intentioned, we believe it inappropriately regulates a biosimilar drug market in a way that creates barriers to access and increase cost for consumers. It does this by requiring the pharmacist to communicate to the prescriber about the dispensing of a specific product provided to the patient for no real clinical reason.",0.0
False,,"States do not need to enact these barriers, and we aren't the only ones saying this. The FDA has said that the standards it develops for determining whether a branded biologic is interchangeable with an approved biosimilar, and therefore safer substitution, will be a rigorous process. The FDA has stated that, ""If a biosimilar is designated as interchangeable with a biologic it can expect it to produce the same clinical result as a reference product."" And the FDA Commissioner has stated herself best, as stating that, ""Attempts to undermine the trust in the products are worrisome, and represent a disservice to patients who could benefit from these lower cost treatments.""",0.0
False,,"And there is a basis in law for this position. The Federal Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act statute defines the term interchangeable. ""The term interchangeable or interchangeability in reference to a biological product,"" excuse me, ""that is shown to meet the standards described elsewhere in the law, means that the biological product may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the reference product.""",0.0
False,,"Yet, in a national play, state government is asked to second guess the federal government's authority and expertise on the matter by instituting notice requirements that will make it harder to dispense these products by requiring additional work for the pharmacist, and in essence, placing a scarlet letter, if you will, on the biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar drugs, making them stand out for no apparent reason.",0.0
False,,"We have a drug cost and pricing problem in the US, and it is being felt, not just in the commercial market, but by state government as well. As best illustrated by the Administrations of Reserve of $300 million for the Hepatitis C drugs that incidentally are not even biologics, but in essence we do need help in lowering costs, the costs of drugs, and should not be enacting barriers to access, if a drug has been deemed safe, efficacious, and interchangeable by the FDA, and for these reasons we are opposed to SB 671. Thank you.",0.0
False,,I'll be brief. Good morning madam chair and members. I'm Victoria Rome with the Natural Resource Defense Council. We strongly support SB 555 to promote more sufficient delivery of water to our homes and buildings. Urban water systems deliver treated water under pressure to their customers through miles of pipes.,0.0
False,,"These pressurized systems include large numbers of valves, joints, and connections. With resulting unavoidable water loses. As Senator Wolk stated, reports have found significant water being lost through these systems. Which also means that we have a huge opportunity to save more water by improving water loss management.",0.0
False,,SB 555 would require annual reporting on water loss findings beginning in 2017. Thus providing the information on water leaks and losses on a more frequent and useful basis. The bill also requires that the water audit reports be validated by technical experts who can ensure the reliability of the data. As we grapple with another year of drought it is more urgent than ever that we improve water efficiency throughout the state.,0.0
False,,"SB 555 addresses one important but traditionally overlooked sector where we can save water in a cost effective manner. Please vote ""aye"" on the bill. Thank you.",0.0

False,,Californians have the right to know what is in their cleaning products to make healthy and responsible buying decisions.,0.0

False,,I don't believe they want to go in that direction. And I'm very sensitive to the whole issue of trade secrets.,0.0
False,,"With technology, using a website, and maybe working with the industry and others to make it very clear, maybe even on the website, what things could be harmful to you.",0.0
False,,"I know for a fact what kind of brought this to me in light, we have a colleague that has an allergy. And one time we, he just got a little, a little dot, a little drop of shrimp on him, and he almost died.",0.0

False,,"And then I watch all these commercials late at night, whether it's heart disease, Viagra, whatever, and they mention a litany from diarrhea to death, and I'm like, I feel like I'm overburdened with all the disclaimer on it.",0.0
False,,"We also realize that it's very important to have that. So this bill is about providing information so that we don't have any deaths, and we can make it better.",0.0
False,,I'm open to all those ideas. I'm open to looking at font size. I'm open to looking at grace period for it to be implemented.,0.0
False,,"I'm open, definitely open, to limiting the number of ingredients on a label so that we can reach that threshold that we understand, that we get to with the consumer, that it will be very helpful to the consumer.",0.0

False,,I love where you're trying to go. I don't k now that the bill in its current form actually gets there.,0.0
False,,"And especially when you state this issue, of ages, lower wage workers, women, people of color, immigrants, and not to say anything, I'm somebody with a PhD; I can't understand half the things that I read on labels.",0.0
False,,"So I don't know how helpful it is for somebody that you're trying to protect to have a long laundry list of things that they don't know, first of all, what those things mean for the most part.",0.0
False,,I mean not many of us sitting up here do know what every single label means or ingredient and which ones are dangerous and which ones aren't. And who's got the time then to go look all those things up to see if it's dangerous or not?,0.0
False,,"So it seems to me it'd be a better use of time to have things that are actually dangerous listed for people, and then they can make those decisions.",0.0
False,,And right now what we're asking is to list more dangerous things on. The previous proposition only went to a certain threshold.,0.0
False,,So we're trying to make sure it does become a little more comprehensive to include everything possible.,0.0
False,,I believe there's a compromise to be had. To make sure that the bill moves forward. And I need to get both sides together to get there.,0.0
False,,"Okay, so Madame Chair, I'm, for me this should not be this controversial or just have angst to the committee.",0.0

False,,"Some examples of some admission criteria preferences, admissions requirement that we are seeking to eliminate in the charter school environment include as was mentioned by the senator requiring volunteer hours. I was recently actually this year public advocates put out a piece of research regarding their-- They looked at 500 schools and they found essentially that 30% of those schools and my math is slow, that's probably like 165 schools or so had volunteer hour requirements. Now, that may work if you had two parents and you know, one was working and the other was home and was available to volunteer at the school. Some of these had up to 80, 90 hour requirements a year. So, for a, you know, grandmother who is working two jobs and they may-- that family probably won't even apply to the school when they see the set of requirements. It's a deterrent when they actually see the application.",0.0
False,,"One quick example at Santiago charter school authorized by Orange Unified School District, they require 12 service hours and that parents fill out a form indicating whether they would like to volunteer for those hours or donate money, for every $10 donated, you will receive one service hour credit. That's an example of a kind of discriminatory admission requirements we're talking about.",0.0
False,,"The second one, academic the senator mentioned that also in some cases particularly in San Bernardino, a charter school named Public Safety Academy made headlines this year about having a minimum GPA of 2.0 to get into the school. Now, in some cases, you do have magnate schools as part of a larger school that have a GPA or we've seen gate programs as part of the school. That's different from having a GPA requirement at, you know, the entire school where the charter school is physically is not letting people in who are not achieving well particularly with respect to the fact that in '92 when charter schools were established in the state of California, one of the explicit purposes and I'm reading from ed. code about why charter schools were created was to increase learning opportunities for all pupils with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for pupils who identified as academically low-achieving. So if you're meant to serve low-achieving students, it doesn't make sense to have a 2.0 GPA bar.",0.0
False,,"Increasingly, we have seen these admission requirements and preferences getting more and more creative. One of the most creative ones I saw was here locally at Natomas Charter School that has in their lottery policy, yes it has a performing arts mission and yes they have auditions, I would suggest that as a tax payer and my son takes piano lessons, even if he was really horrible at piano, you know, my tax dollar fund that school, he should be able to attend that school regardless of what his ability is at piano.",0.0
False,,"But specifically in their preferences, they include a preference score, elected adviser to the board and I would submit what is an elected adviser to the board. To me what that means is a school board sits together and maybe they elect somebody who's kid gets a special preference to come into that school. Those kinds of creative preferences, it should not be allowed, they're discriminatory. And so what we're looking at here is-- and these are the result truly of like an hour of Google research on the internet. So, if those are the once that are public, you can imagine how many other types of admission criteria and preferences haven't been put out to the public and are also, you know, limiting student access at charter schools. Charter schools are public schools. They must be available to all students. We urge your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Thank you madam chair. Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association, I want to start with a couple of comments. One, we really appreciate the fact that the author has spent some time with us this week especially and we really appreciate your work on this and your staff's work.

We're taking one last look at it but we feel optimistic.",0.0
False,,"I do feel obligated to say though in response to the supporters that charter schools do not adopt the mission requirements and preferences unilaterally without oversight. They are part of the petition process. They must go to the school district and the school district must approve them. So if there are preferences and if there are admission requirements, it must be done with the approval of the school district, a very important distinction that was not apparent in the supporter side of the presentation.",0.0
False,,"The second piece of the bill has to do with the disciplinary policies. The proposal as it is right now would impose an additional 53 education code requirements on charter schools. When some re-regulation of charter schools is proposed, the first question out of our mouth is always is, what's the justification? Demonstrate to us that there was a problem.",0.0
False,,"So far, we have not been able to get the information that justifies the problem. We have taken effect. We have witnesses here to talk about this. We have taken the data from CDE on suspensions especially expulsion data unfortunately is not as good as suspension data. We have used the same methodology that UCLA has done in their unreleased report. We've not even seen it, so people are quoting it. We're not sure how they're quoting it. And have found that our experience with suspensions is actually better than traditional public schools. We suspend less students than traditional public schools.",0.0
False,,"The references to national studies, keep in mind that we're a 50-state country and post national studies are looking at all of the 50 states. They are not looking at California specifically or exclusively.

False,,"We feel very proud of what we do relative to disciplinary policies and I should point out once again disciplinary policies are approved by the school district. They are not approved unilaterally by the charter school. And they are outlined in great deal. If anybody has ever seen a charter petition, it is not this thick, it is this thick. So all those things that are in two pages in the statute are actually in four or five two-inch binders and they include expansive information on disciplinary policies. So we can-- if people demonstrate to us that there's really a problem, then let's talk about it. But that has not been demonstrated, we've-- as repeatedly for data that justifies the need for this portion of the bill and have not received it.",0.0
False,,"The last two items in the bill, I'll hit very quickly, there are changes to the notification process where a student leaves a charter school. Again, we're not sure why that's necessary, dropping the time frame from 30 days to 10 days is a challenge for charter schools. Anybody in education knows that there are times when students leave school and don't come back as fast as you would think they would. Not quite sure where they've gone, family emergencies, family vacations, where the schXTool is not notified. In 10 days, we don't necessarily know why the student left or whether the student is coming back.",0.0
False,,"We're also concerned about handing documentation-- confidential documentation to the school district if we don't know for sure that the student who does leave us is going to go to that school district. We're handing them student level, instructional data. We're providing them HIPAA data that is protected under state and federal law and handing it to a school district when they don't know the school, the district is going to take that student is a liability against us and a liability against the school district.",0.0
False,,"The last piece on teacher turnover, we actually think there might be something useful. We don't think it should be district level. We think the policy should be set at the state Department of Education and then have the districts implement. Otherwise, you're going to have a thousand different data collections that may not match. You're not going to have any comparability for that data. We think if it flows from the state down to the district, you might actually get something that could be useful to everybody. For those reasons at this point, we are opposed to the bill. Thank you.",0.0
False,,"My name is Daniel McLaughlin. I'm the founder and CEO of the One Purpose School. We will serve a population of 97% free and reduced lunch actually in your district, Senator Leno.

False,,"And with respect to restorative justice, we did have a long conversation in the last legislative session around willful defiance, around the idea that we need to figure out ways not to send kids home, that we need to figure out ways to provide supports for kids, and to be blunt, none of that conversation had any impact on the charter school environment because at charter schools, the education code that we're talking about there with respect to suspension and expulsion is waived.",0.0
False,,"So in other words, they weren't required necessarily to follow some of those provisions that we were establishing that truly represent a good practice at all California public schools. So there is explicit ed code that says in terms of alternative to suspension and expulsion, that rather than send a child home, a principal could implement several alternatives to suspension and expulsion. One of those explicitly in code being restorative justice.",0.0
False,,"So in putting forth a requirement that charter schools comply with the suspension and expulsion provisions of the education code, it also then delineates what are some reasons that a child could be suspended from school, what alternatives are kind of best practices recommended through statute that a principal could use rather than send a child home.",0.0
False,,"So in essence, I would say just the opposite. It would encourage the use of alternatives and explicitly restorative justice enforcing charter schools to comply with the suspension expulsion provisions of the education code. Some of the data that the opposition was referencing with respect to suspension and expulsion what the data shows is very incomplete because there's not a requirement to use the suspension and expulsion provision. So then to rely on what that data says when a district is not obligated to report that data-- I'm sorry, a charter school is not obligated to report that data in the first place is extremely problematic.",0.0
False,,"Just kidding. I would say there's two sides to that conversation. On the one hand, I know that recently, both the Charter Schools Association and-- not recently, I would say two years ago maybe. There was a conversation around what kinds of protections a charter school should have if they were being sued by the public. Would it be similar to a traditional public school if there was a safety issue? And the conversation was just locally actually around Sacramento High School, charter high school where for example a child is not automatically suspended or expelled for example for sexual assault or for bringing a weapon to school and does that create a different standard of safety?",0.0
False,,"So in the one hand, I think that's part of the conversation, but I also hear what you're saying about do some of these zero tolerance policies impact flexibility? Certainly, the conversation around Senate Bill 420 was just the opposite. It was a conversation that was focused on how do we essentially stop sending kids home, which is not helping kids and instead help those kids.",0.0
False,,"So in-- again in requiring compliance with the suspension expulsion provisions of the education code, you bring that conversation to bear on the charter school community as well and encourage those alternatives. That's truly where the-- That's the direction we're heading in the legislature and we think it should apply to all public schools whether traditional or whether charter.",0.0

False,,Evaluation is already based on multiple factors and teachers are already a part of the process of determining evaluation procedures as of course they should be. But introducing the design or the selection rather of evaluation standards into the negotiation and collective bargaining environment is a fundamental change.,0.0
False,,"Simply, think about in these terms. We are going from developing evaluation standards to negotiating them. That is a tremendous change. This creates the opportunities as my colleague said for stakeholders to leverage important evaluation standards related to student achievement or gains related to salary or negation.",0.0

False,,"We have been having conversations with the administrators, with school boards, with the Charter Schools Association, with Classified School Staff to bring forward the best policy. And I know that this committee last week considered bill by Senator Pavley which was about a very small authorizer that placed the charter school outside of its school district and what I want to clarify is that that was an isolated incident.",0.0
False,,That there are several tiny districts throughout the state where they're authorizing charter schools when they don't have either the capacity to do that kind of oversight and so I know that my colleague from California Virtual Academy is going to talk about some of their structure and some similar things that we've seen in different areas with authorizers across the state.,0.0
False,,"But the questions we were proposing as stake holders is number one like what are-- let's better define what exactly are your responsibilities and obligations with respect to oversight and number two, what do you need to have in place to carry out those duties.",0.0
False,,"And so what this bill suggests is that when you're considering what kind of support you have from parents, from teachers to establish a new charter school based on the petition that you also consider a report about your capacity which hopefully will be useful in determining what staff you have in place to do that important oversight work.",0.0
False,,"Do you need to build new structures? Do you need to have new staff etcetera. We were pleased to see that in the opposition letter from the Charter Schools Association, that appear they agreed on that point. That it would be useful for a school district to assess how it will conduct oversight.",0.0
False,,"Additionally, this bill suggests that when a new charter petition comes forward, we also consider what the impact is going to be on other school districts-- sorry, other schools where the district has oversight capacity. In most cases charter schools are authorized by a school district although we recognize some could be authorized by county office, some by state board.",0.0
False,,"The idea is that the authorizer takes a look at their charter schools, takes a look at their traditional public efforts to provide better coordination. And develops a plan for all the schools that they're responsible for oversight looking at things like the geographic distribution of schools,",0.0
False,,"projected demographic changes and that new charter petitions that come forward are evaluated in respect to how they impact that plan. What we have seen from voters is-- before any charter schools approved, voters would love us to conduct an analysis of the impact that the school will have on neighborhood public schools. The public doesn't want their great neighborhood public school harmed by decisions that are made by their elected officials.",0.0
False,,"In the polling data we see basically it's that school down the street two blocks down where I send my kids has a great for foreign arts program, has a wonderful library, has a science lab, whatever you're doing as a district don't impact this great neighborhood school. So what is this bill about? This bill is about what all Californians want which is a great school in every neighborhood. We urge your aye vote.",0.0
False,,"Madam Chair and members, Nancy Chaires Espinoza with the California School Boards Association. As you know current law does not allow a local education agency to deny a charter petition even if the school board or county office knows that doing so would result in negative certification or if they know, they simply don't have that capacity to provide the necessary oversight.",0.0
False,,This bill would provide that ability which we think is very important and in some areas where there are-- where there's declining enrollment or w have small rural school districts for example this is a particularly important issue so we respectfully ask for your support for this measure.

False,,"Thank you, Madam Chair and members. Rand Martin on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association. We really appreciate the work of the committee and certainly the author in agreeing to take out the negative fiscal impact portion of the bill that was the biggest part of the bill that we objected to but we are still very concerned about the bidding practices piece.",0.0
False,,"I do want to point out that as Mr. Bramble indicated, we did think-- do think the idea of the school district doing some analysis on their capacity to do oversight is really helpful and we think that they should be doing that not as a reason to reject the charter but so they can prepare themselves to do the right thing when the charter is authorized.",0.0
False,,"And hey, they make sure that they put the right resources into it. I do want to comment on one of the comments that the-- one of the CAVA representatives made about the oversight of this-- of the charter schools from tiny school districts. For those who may not be aware charter schools have to pay anywhere from 1 to 3% of their revenue to the oversight district.",0.0
False,,So a very tiny school district that's authorizing a school that has 3000 students in San Diego is bringing in $300 000 from the charter school. I think that's enough money to pay for sufficient resources to be doing aggressive oversight. I think Madam Chair in your comments on SB 322 earlier today really hit the nail on the head relative to that bill and this bill.,0.0
False,,"The problem is really about oversight and as you've instructed us and I'm taking it back to CCSA, let's see if we can come up with some ideas to strengthen oversight but clearly, resources is not a problem. We're paying a lot of money to school districts to make sure that we're doing out job.",0.0

False,,So it's impossible for us to fully analyze the impact of these amendments on the bill. We do know from a cursory glance of the language that we are still in opposition to the bill.,0.0
False,,"The prior approval piece coming out we do believe is important on the heels of the debate over Prop 45, however, there are still several issues with the bill that we have and are likely to have moving forward.",0.0
False,,"First and foremost members, the bill is very cumbersome and in certain respects suffers from a bit of an identity crisis in that the first section of the bill requires health plans to report aggregate large employer data to the Department of Managed Healthcare and the Department of Insurance.",0.0
False,,And part two of the bill requires health plans to then further report individual large employer data to those regulators as well for the purposes of regulatory action and based on triggers. What we fear would be a consequence of putting these provisions into law is really the loss of innovation and large group market.,0.0
False,,"Based on a survey that we conducted a number of years ago, we found through our members that there are about 14 to 15,000 large group policies in the state of California. The large employer market is highly customized. It's not standardized like the individual or small group market.",0.0
False,,"That's because employers sometimes want more, and they're willing to pay for more. For instance, some employers will initiate a wellness program or things of that nature as part of their benefits to their employees. And of course the health plan is there to help them to design those benefits.",0.0
False,,"If we lose customization in that market as a way to avoid regulatory action or review of the rates, large employers are also in a better position to self-insure their products, which means that if they do that, that escapes essentially any type of oversight by the state or requirements of state legislation for the most part.",0.0
False,,So that is just a public policy consideration for legislators to consider if we keep adding to the administrative load of the large employer market. We will also say that through the Affordable Care Act health plans in all markets have to comply with a medical loss ratio.,0.0
False,,"So what this means is that 80 to 85% of the premium dollar by law, federal and state, has to go to medical services. The remaining 20 to 15 is reserved for necessary administrative expenses in rate of return.",0.0
False,,"So if premiums remain flat or if they go down or if they go up, you know, in our view that is a true reflection of the cost of care for those products.",0.0
False,,"Furthermore, as noted by the supporters, we negotiate at the end of last session and removed our opposition to Senator Leno's SB1182, which allows large purchasers, including labor trusts, to request from the health plan claims data that they can use to review the costs.",0.0
False,,So we don't understand why in the first year of implementing that bill we need to be back here debating that information being sent to the state.,0.0
False,,"We're in the first year of implementing that bill in Senator Mitchell's committee Senate sub three, the DMHC requested, and I believe those positions were granted, positions that would help oversee the implementation of that bill.",0.0
False,,"If the sponsors of that bill are running into problems with our member health plans, they can come to us and talk about that. But that bill was a negotiated agreement at the end of session between us and the sponsors of the bill.",0.0
False,,We're facing several cost drivers in the healthcare system. Drugs are on the rise. Provider consolidation is a problem. We face several challenges. Health plans do what they can to negotiate the best rates that they can on behalf of the purchaser.,0.0
False,,So we're highly opposed to the bill and ask you to vote no. Thank you.,0.0
False,,"They would be subject to rate review and if they hit a certain threshold it would be, they could be deemed at unreasonable by the regulator. It's my understanding. I mean, again, the bill is just being amended today so there would be a regulatory action associated with that filing. It's not merely pure transparency.",0.0
False,,"So, you know, we don't have a cost estimate for this particular bill but a rate review bills for a large group in the past have triggered Department of Finance opposition due to the state cost associated.",0.0
False,,"I don't have a dollar figure associated with particular bill yet, but because this triggers individual filings we would expect at least the cost to be high.",0.0
False,,"Yeah, yes we do expect this to be expensive for the companies, again, we are just reviewing the amendments but I would require that hiring of new staff, actuaries and other types of staff in order to prepare what we think will be volumes and volumes of individual filings.",0.0
False,,"Again, at, for my testimony the large employer market is highly customized. There are thousands of different policies.",0.0
False,,"Some employers actually have different policies agreed to even with the same health plan, so a health plan may have a contract with a large employer for various products within their company, so it's highly complicated in customized business.",0.0
False,,"It's a fair question. Senator, again, we're going to have to review the amendments. If the factors, we believe the factors are, conflict with which might be currently cataloged by the health plan.",0.0
False,,Good afternoon Mr. Chair and members. Connie Delgado with the California Hospital Association. Here in opposition for two main reasons.,0.0

False,,"Well, there are existing penalties that CDPH has that are for the, under the EMTALA regulations, under those guidelines.",0.0
False,,"This bill would create a separate scheme with additional penalties for that that are higher than the current, so essentially it's the current law plus and additional higher penalty.",0.0

We certainly appreciate and share the author's concern about opioid drug abuse which of course results in far too many overdoses and deaths. This is why health plans in part utilize medical management controls that prevent the expenditure of premium dollars on abusive behavior. So it is a serious problem for America, but however, we do not believe that this bill will significantly curb the abuse of these drugs as eloquently laid out by Mr. Caldwell.",0.0
False,,"Our association typically opposes new health benefit mandates because they drive up health care costs for enrollees in the individual and employer markets. New mandates may conflict with the federal Affordable Care Act rules regarding essential health benefits. According to those rules, states have to pay 100% of the health exchange subsidies to consumers for the cost associated with new mandates that extend beyond the essential health benefits. Mandates reduce the flexibility in benefit design for large employers. They also increase premiums.",0.0
False,,"On this last point we do believe that this bill will increase costs for the purchasers of health care. The, this committee as well as Health Committee could have benefited from the independent analysis by on the premium impacts of this bill. As is the usual process for mandate bills. As, as noted by Mr. Caldwell, this bill has been introduced in a number of other states and in those states, the fiscal notes indicate premium increases as a result of that legislation.",0.0

False,,"These formerly incarcerated individuals are someones parent, spouse, child, or friend. One of there biggest barriers of successfully re-entering into society is securing a stable housing element.",0.0
False,,Unfortunately many rental housing providers only view applicants who have a criminal record as a box on application rather than as a rehabilitated person. You know that box.,0.0
False,,"It asks applicants whether they have a criminal conviction. Checking that box is usually an automatic toss into the trash can without any opportunity for the housing provider to fully judge the merit of the applicant, or the applicant to explain unknown details or inaccuracies about his or her conviction.",0.0
False,,AB 396 would ban the box on rental housing applications to delay when a housing provider can ask about criminal history. This would allow a very small window for at least some dialogue between the provider and the applicant.,0.0

False,,"Who had tenants and had to deal with protecting tax payer's money and liability as someone as unbelievably respectful of the housing market, the apartment owners and the challenge that they have, especially in the inner city in providing housing.",0.0
False,,"And I guess most important that someone who's basically come a long way is a apartment owner. Who if I provided something or legislation that was unreasonably onerous, that would probably be more painful to me than anything else.",0.0
False,,I would like to say that we're willing to work with the community that provides his housing. Out intent was never to impose any undo hardship on them.,0.0
False,,"In fact if the 14 day waiting period is too much we can, we can shorten it so that they do not have an undue burden on them being able to rent their, their, their facilities, their apartments in a reasonable period of time. That, that is not the point of the legislation.",0.0

False,,"In fact we believe the time that it takes to, to do that is not as long. And, the time to do it even, during a, the background check. To do it almost, immediately after if you're sure, you want to rent to that person. You could almost do it in the cessation where they don't lose time.",0.0
False,,"And, I think, we can walk, work, walk through that. But, first, I need for individuals to be amenable to at least, to even try to, to work with, with talking to people who were formerly incarcerated. Because at the end of the day, we have not, I repeat, this legislation does not strip their ability to say no.",0.0
False,,"And if I have to put in language, if they need language, to protect them from any liability afterwords, that would give them some kind of assurances that they won't get sued if someone if something happens, but this is a litigious state, people sue anyway, but is there anything to give them some type of comfort that the intent of this bill is not to set them up, to be sued.",0.0
False,,"We're more than willing, more than willing to provide that, that, provide that language in the bill.",0.0
False,,"I would just like to respond with the evidence related to three critical points that were raised by the opposition. As the assembly member stated, this bill is not in any way intended to infringe upon property owners from not considering the information of a criminal history.",0.0
False,,"As the assembly member stated, this is about banning the box that puts those applications in the trash can before anything else gets considered. First, I would like to address, HUD.",0.0
False,,"So, the, opposition's testimony noted a zero tolerance position and, a position out of HUD that, that discourages the use of this information. That is actually very afar from where HUD is currently on this issue.",0.0
False,,"Yes, Mr. Chair because it and just want you to know, and, and maybe we just, you know, we get wrapped up sometimes into naming things. And maybe banning the box was not the correct title, cause we're not really banning the box. We're, we're holding off when you check the box.",0.0
False,,"Temporarily suspending that time until the end of the application. That's really what we're, we're asking for. And as far as someone's criminal record, the main goal of this is to get our society used to have informally incarcerate come back into society.",0.0
False,,"So your, to your point even expungements, I would rather have someone who's, who's been a credit to society, worked a hard life, raised their family, now wants to rent and then have a dialogue with a landlord.",0.0
False,,"Express what they've done for the last 20 years, but maybe 20 years ago they did something really horrendous. But now, they've changed their life around and because it was expunged, I would rather have them have that dialogue, cuz I'd rather have them learn that people can turn their lives around.",0.0
False,,"And I'd rather have someone tell them, yes, I was a former rapist, but I've, I turned my life around. And, and now, I'm a credit to society. I'm a deacon in a church. I go to work every day. I, I'm soccer league coach, all of that.",0.0
False,,"I'd rather have that happen, than to hide it from, from potential landlords. So yes, I am definitely willing to, to work with you on that front.",0.0
False,,"I just want to assure the committee that if we're, we're let out of this committee we will work together, and if I have to serve as referee, we will, I will do that.",0.0
